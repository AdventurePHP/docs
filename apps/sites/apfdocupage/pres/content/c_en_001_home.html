  <strong>Ralf Schubert</strong>, an enthusiastic APF developer likes the framework giving the chance
  to easily develop resuable gui elements (aka. widgets). To support beginners, he wrote this article
  to give a brief introduction into the framework and to ease the first steps using the APF.

<h3>Version 1.10 (stable) released!</h3>
<div class="section">
  <img src="http://media.adventure-php-framework.org/content/release_1_10.gif" alt="Adventure PHP Framework - Release 1.10 (stable): Refactoring, performance optimization, full PHP5 support" border="0" style="float: right;"/>
  The APF team is proud to anounce the stable release of the 1.10 series (04.09.2009). Within this
  maintenance release, development entirely switched to PHP5. A compatibility version for PHP4 will
  be available since the beginning of 2010. Beneath some clean-ups and refactorings , several
  performance optimization tasks guarantee excellent performance. The probably biggest technical
  innovation is the introduction of the "dependency injection container" similar to the objection
  initialization of SPRING (JAVA). Further, this release contains many features, that were discussed
  in the developer forum to be included.
  <br />
  <br />
  Morover, the final release of the 1.10 branch contains all changes concerning the feedback on the
  two release candidates.
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <span class="newfunction110">Introduction of PHP5 language elements:</span>
  <br />
  As of this release, development completely switched to PHP 5. This means, that the code now contains
  all relevant PHP5 language elements. The PHP 4 version is only a generated compatibility version.
  For this reason, you must now take care about the visibility of methods and class members. Please
  ensure, that the visibility is recognized within your existing applications.
  <br />
  <br />
  <span class="newfunction110">Refactoring of the APF filter api:</span>
  <br />
  Due to errors with the PHP version >=5.2.10 and >=5.3.0, the filter API was refactored. This
  affects the signature of the <strong>filter()</strong>, that now does only expect one parameter -
  the input. Details can be taken from the the API documentation of the <strong>AbstractFilter</strong>
  class. These changes also affect the form filters. For further information, please consult the
  <a href="./?Page=087-Filter" title="Filter">filter documentation</a>.
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <span class="newfunction110">Cleanups & optimization!</span>
  <br />
  Along with the code cleanups, the following classes are renamed:
  <ul>
     <li>serviceManager -> ServiceManager</li>
     <li>sessionManager -> SessionManager</li>
     <li>benchmarkTimer -> BenchmarkTimer</li>
  </ul>
  Further, the comment module now uses the captcha module to secure the form and brings a much more
  flexible HTML layout, that can be adapted using CSS.
  Besides, the __extractTagLibTags() parser method was optimized for less CPU and RAM consumption.
  These changes affirm the performance tests described on
  <doku:link>http://adventure-php-framework.org/Seite/103-Yii-vs-APF</doku:link>.
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <span class="newfunction110">Introduction of the DIServiceManager!</span>
  <br />
  As of release 1.10, the DIServiceManager was introduced. This component provides a "dependency
  injection container", that enables the developer to initialize application components with
  configurable parameters as desired. In the past, dependency injection was only possible for well
  defined params within the framework - language and context of the current application. Please refer
  to chapter <doku:link>http://adventure-php-framework.org/Page/107-Services</doku:link> for a
  detailed description of the dependency injection implementation of the APF and the object
  initialization possible with the new component. The section also includes application samples.
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <span class="newfunction110">Enhancement of existing components:</span>
  <br />
  In the course of refactoring placed in the 1.10 branch, several components were reworked to meet the
  extended needs. Among these are the umgtManager, the GenericORMapper and the MySQLHandler. As
  discussed in the german language forum, the business component umgtManager now features some more
  loadUserBy*() methods. So ist is much more easy to select users by given keys within applications
  based on the usermanagement module. To easy statement debugging, the MySQLHandler now supports
  statement logging into a separate log file. Now you can see all statements sent to the database -
  especially generated ones - looking at the statement logfile. Based on this change, the GenericORMapper
  can be created in "debug mode" using an additional factory switch.
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <span class="newfunction110">Feedback on the RCs:</span>
  <br />
  The most frequently discussed topic was the compatibility to the PHP5.3 version. For this reason,
  the filter API and the SessionManager was adapted as well as some descendent components. Beneath,
  some errors within the iterator tag and the GenericORMapper were fixed and the functionality of the
  ServiceManager and the RequestHandler were improved.

  Today we are proud to announce the availability of the release 1.9 (stable). This production release
  contains:
  <br />
  <br />
  <span class="newfunction19">Usermanagement:</span>
  <br />
  The <strong>usermanagement</strong> module was subjected to refactoring within the 1.9 series.
  This means:
  <ul>
    <li>More easy inclusion into existing applications via taglib.</li>
    <li>Business component as a central interface to the module.</li>
    <li>
      Enhanced
      <a href="./?Page=095-Module-usermanagement" title="Modul - Usermanagement">documentation</a>
      with many examples.
    </li>
    <li>
      Direct usage of the user management database through the
      <a href="./?Page=063-Generic-OR-mapper" title="GenericORMapper">GenericORMapper</a>.
    </li>
  </ul>
  Concerning these changes and by force of the circumstance, that is is built on top of the
  GenericORMapper, it can be uses as a reusable and multitenant user base for use within various
  applications.
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <span class="newfunction19">Filter!</span>
  <br />
  The filter issue was completely changed for the 1.9 series. The advantages of the new implementation
  are:
  <ul>
    <li>
      More easy configuration of the
      <a href="./?Pagee=087-Filter" title="Filter">input- and output filter</a> via the registry.
    </li>
    <li>
      Transparent adaption of the filters
      <a href="./?Page=087-Filter#4-Design-and-function" title="Filter">to your application cases</a>
      without the need to change existing functionalities.
    </li>
    <li>
      Creation of various url layouts (e.g. developing a CMS).
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="./?Page=011-Forms#5-Usage-of-form-filters" title="Form filter">Form filter</a> to
      secure user input on text fields.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <br />
  <span class="newfunction19">Remake of approved components:</span>
  <br />
  In the course of refactoring placed in the 1.8 branch, several components were reworked to meet
  the extended needs. These are:
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>ImageManager</strong>: Refactoring eases usage of the class and provides a more
      convenient API.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Pager</strong>: Refactoring, that it can be used to page result sets loaded by the
      <a href="./?Page=063-Generic-OR-mapper" title="GenericORMapper">GenericORMapper</a>. The new
      session caching facility gains performance of the module.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <br />
  <span class="newfunction19">Global error and exception handling!</span>
  <br />
  The error handling of the framework is now arranged in a more flexible way. This means:
  <ul>
    <li>
      The component, that is used by the framework to handle upcomming errors can now be configured
      by use of the registry. You can, too, define your
      <a href="./?Page=101-Error-handling" title="Error handling">own error handler</a>, if necessaray.
    </li>
    <li>
      Additionally, the PHP 5 release now contains a seperate
      <a href="./?Page=102-Exception-handling" title="Exception handling">exception handling</a>.
      The mechnism is similar to the error handling included in the framework.
    </li>
  </ul>
  This mechanism enables the developer to catch unhandled exceptions within an application. The
  documentation now provides extensive information on the functionality, the extension and the
  configuration of this feature.
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <span class="newfunction19">Cleanup!</span>
  <br />
  As mentioned in the changelog of the 1.8 release, deprecated components have been removed. These
  are:
  <ul>
    <li>filesystemHandler</li>
    <li>abstractCacheManager</li>
    <li>cacheV4Manager</li>
    <li>objectCacheManager</li>
