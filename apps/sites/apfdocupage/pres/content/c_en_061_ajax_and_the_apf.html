<a name="1-Introduction"></a><h3>1. Introduction</h3>
AJAX is noted for beeing a common technique to build web applications, that are more agile compared
to standard applications. It gives the possibility to change specific parts of the DOM of a HTML
page by using the XMLHTTPRequest implementation and some lines of java script code.
<br />
<br />
AJAX is not brand-new and there are a plenty of online arcticles about building AJAX applications.
At a glance, the following resources are worth being read:

Starting to write AJAX applications you will face with the problem to integrate AJAX widgets and
dynamic updates of certain areas of your web page into existing application structures and designs.
This fact often leads to the problem, that AJAX-featured applications tend to be not well-designed.
Im most cases, the client <-> server communication is done by requesting a file (e.g. a PHP file),
that sends back an XML string containing the information the client needs. In common for each AJAX
"action" one appropriate file is created. This does not only lead to complexity but also to
redundant code in the server side scripts. A second problem is security. Due to the fact, that the
application code merely resides on the client and hence can be analysed and manipulated easily, an
application tends to get insecure.
<br />
<br />
The two problems described above are well known problems. On this account many server and cliend
side AJAX frameworks have been built to solve the daily life problems a programmer is facing during
AJAX application development. However, building AJAX aplications is not as easy as it is described
in many of those "getting started" tutorials.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name="2-Tools-included"></a><h3>2. Which tools are included in the APF?</h3>
Basically the adventure php framework features no special AJAX component to use either on the client
or on the server side. Having no special module does not mean, that the APF does not have a way to
facilitate server side programming within AJAX applications.
<br />
<br />
To assist implementation of server side AJAX application parts, the front controller can be used.
Taking the front controller supports the programmer to build server side AJAX "actions" in a
standardized and powerful way. He is not forced to create several action files and reimplement
the functionality included in those files several times. Each AJAX action can be represented by one
special front controller action. Due to the fact that the front controller pattern is located in the
business layer, the front controller action can easily use existing application components (e.g.
business or data layer classes). Moreover using the front controller makes it easy to access the
parameters the action is called with. In other words, all modules known for building server side
applications can be involved.
<br />
<br />
Due to a wide range of java sctip AJAX frameworks the adventure php framework features no
java script libraries. For client side purpose any common AJAX framework can be used to create the
desired widgets. The following list shows a selection of famous java script frameworks:
<ul>

<a name="3-My-first-AJAX-application"></a><h3>3. My first AJAX application</h3>
To not getting you bored with theory, this chapter shows you, how to build a AJAX web application
with the adventure php framework from the scratch.
<br />
<br />
<a name="3-1-Requirements"></a><h4>3.1. Requirements and considerations</h4>
Due to the fact, that we both are good software architects, we need to think about the requirements
of the software, we want to create. To keep things simple, the application to design should be
simple and easy to imagine. I think a news box would be a good example to show how an AJAX
application can be built with the adventure php framework.
<br />
<br />
Let me give you a brief description of the major features:
<ul>
  <li>news box can be included in any adventure php framework application</li>
  <li>news can be paged clockwise and vice versa</li>
  <li>news are read from several text files, each containing one news page, to keep maintenance easy</li>
</ul>
<br />
<a name="3-2-Design"></a><h4>3.2. Design of the application</h4>
Compared to a standard application only the paging functionality is realized in AJAX style. The rest
of the module can be implemented as customary. The concepts used here (commonly known as patterns)
can be comprehended reading the
<a href="./?Page=032-Comment-function" title="comment function">comment function tutorial</a>. But the
focus of this article lies on the design of the AJAX part of the application.
<br />
<br />
In order to implement the paging functionality we need client and server addons. On the cliend side
we will use some java script code around the XMLHTTPRequest object to draw the widgets and to catch
user interaction. The server side is done by a special front controller action, that reads the
desired news page and gives it back to the client.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name="4-Implementation"></a><h3>4. Implementation</h3>
To make sure, that the news box can be included in any APF style application we create a new module
named <strong>newspager</strong>. In the first instance, the folders and files must be created as
follows:
<pre class="tagexample">
  /apps/
        modules/
                newspager/
                          biz/
                              actions/
                          data/
                          pres/
                               documentcontroller/
                               templates/
</pre>
As a next step, the files necessary must be created. As already mentioned above, we need to create
the following files:
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>biz/newspagerManager.php</strong>:
    <br />
    business component, that is used to get the news page content
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>biz/newspagerContent.php</strong>:
    <br />
    the domain object, that contains the content of one news page
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>biz/actions/newspagerAction.php</strong>:
    <br />
    file that contains the front controller action class
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>biz/actions/newspagerInput.php</strong>:
    <br />
    file that contains the front controller input class
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>data/newspagerMapper.php</strong>:
    <br />
    data layer component, that loads the newspager content from text files
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>pres/documentcontroller/newspager_v1_controller.php</strong>:
    <br />
    document controller, that generates the output of the module
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>pres/templates/newspager.html</strong>:
    <br />
    template file, that contains the style of the module and the additional java script code needed
    to add AJAX style paging
  </li>
</ul>
<br />
In this tutorial we are going to use the bottom-up approch during implementation phase.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name="4-1-Data-layer"></a><h4>4.1. Data layer implementation</h4>
The data layer's duty is to load content from plain text files, map a news file into a domain
object and give it back to the business layer. The news files are located in the
<strong>./frontend/news/</strong> folder located in parallel to the <strong>index.php</strong> file
of a project. Each file contains news text in a certain semantic: the first line is interpreted as
the headline, the second as a subheadline and the rest of the file is assumed to belong to the
content. On this account the domain object mentioned above has three properties: title, subtitle and
content. To have multilanguage support, each file should be named like
<pre class="tagexample">
  news_{LANG}_{PAGENUMBER}.txt
</pre>
Here <strong>{LANG}</strong> must be any two letter ISO language code, <strong>{PAGENUMBER}</strong>
is a number beginning with <strong>1</strong>. As an example, the news pager module can have the
following news files located in <strong>./frontend/news/</strong>:
<pre class="tagexample">
  news_en_1.txt
  news_en_2.txt
  news_en_3.txt
  news_en_4.txt
  news_en_5.txt
  news_it_1.txt
  news_it_2.txt
  news_it_3.txt
  news_it_4.txt
</pre>
The source code of the data layer class can be seen in the code box below:
<br />
<br />
<file:highlight name="newspagerMapper.php" />
<br />
Calling the mapper class like
<php:highlight>
  $M = new newspagerMapper();
  $M->set('Context','sites::apfdocupage');
  $M->set('Language','en');
  echo printObject($M->getNewsByPage(1));
</php:highlight>
is will return an <strong>newspagerContent</strong> object, that contains the information of the
first news page residing in the <strong>news_en_1.txt</strong> file. This object can later on be
used to deliver the xml requested by the java script code executed on the client machine or to
generate the output of the news box during rendering of the page.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name="4-2-Business-layer"></a><h4>4.2. Business layer implementation</h4>
<a name="4-2-1-Domain-object"></a><h5>4.2.1. Domain object</h5>
First of all, we must define the <strong>newspagerContent</strong> class, that was already used in
the data layer component. This class is a simple data storage class, that contains the information
of a certain news page. Due to the fact, that this class inherits from <strong>coreObject</strong>
no more <strong>get()</strong> and <strong>set()</strong> methods must be implemented. The source
code looks like this:
<br />
<br />
<file:highlight name="newspagerContent.php" />
<br />
The attribute <strong>$__NewsCount</strong> was introduced to control the pager widgets.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name="4-2-2-Manager"></a><h5>4.2.2. The manager</h5>
To be compilant to the classical thee tier architecture described in the pattern of the same name,
we introduce a business component, that contains the business logic of the application. In this case
the business layer component (often called <em>manager</em>) only contains of one singe method:
<strong>getNewsByPage()</strong>. The implementation is quite easy and so the php code looks as
follows:
<br />
<br />
<file:highlight name="newspagerManager.php" />
<br />
A unit test for the class and the underlaying data layer may look like this:
<php:highlight>
  $M = new newspagerManager();
  $M->set('Context','sites::apfdocupage');
  $M->set('Language','en');
  echo printObject($M->getNewsByPage());
</php:highlight>
This statement will print out the content of the loaded <strong>newspagerContent</strong> object.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name="4-2-3-AJAX-data-source"></a><h5>4.2.3. AJAX data source</h5>
As mentioned above, the client side java script codes needs a server side data source to obtain the
desired news page via xml. For this reason a front controller action is implemented, that delivers
the desired page. Due to the fact, that we have a business layer component (<em>manager</em>), the
action can make use of this class. The only task is then to transform the object returned by the
business layer component into valid xml and transfer it to the client machine. To indicate, which
page should be served, the front controller action url string does contains the parameter
<strong>page</strong>. Adventure php framework front controller actions normally contain three main
parts: the action class definition, the input class definition and the action configuration that
defines the parameters of the front controller action. Details can be seen on the
<a href="./?Page=012-Frontcontroller" title="front controller">front controller page</a>. Because this
example has no special requirements, the implementation is straight forward.
<br />
<br />
First of all, we have to implement the input object, that is filled with the url parameters present
in the url string when requesting the action. The class must inherit from the
<strong>FrontcontrollerInput</strong> class and the file only contains the following body:
<br />
<br />
<file:highlight name="newspagerInput.php" />
<br />
The action class definition encapsulates the functionality described a few lines above. As described
on the <a href="./?Page=012-Frontcontroller" title="front controller">front controller page</a>, each
action must implement the interface method <strong>run()</strong>, that is called during action
execution by the front controller. This function includes the main capacity and delivers the xml
string to the requestor. The source code may look like follows:
<br />
<br />
<file:highlight name="newspagerAction.php" />
<br />
To be able to write a unit test, or to call the action, the third part of an APF style front
controller action must be added: the configuration. To create this file, we must define, under which
namespace the action should be callable. For this example, we assume, that the action can be executed
using the url definition
<pre class="tagexample">
http://dev.adventure-php-framework.org/~/modules_newspager_biz-action/Pager/page/1/lang/en
 /~/modules_newspager_biz-action/Pager/page/{PAGE}/lang/{LANG}
</pre>
where <strong>{PAGE}</strong> must be replaced by any integer and <strong>LANG</strong> a two letter
ISO language code. Hence, the namespace of the action is <strong>modules::newspager::biz</strong>
and though the configuration file for this action must be created under the folder
<pre class="tagexample">
 /apps/config/modules/newspager/biz/actions/{APPS__CONTEXT}/
</pre>
Thereby <strong>{APPS__CONTEXT}</strong> is the folder path resulting from the current context of the
application. In this example, the context is <strong>sites::demosite</strong>, and consequently, the
full path must be
<pre class="tagexample">
 /apps/config/modules/newspager/biz/actions/sites/demosite/
</pre>
The config file itself must be named
<pre class="tagexample">
 TESTSERVER_actionconfig.ini
</pre>
because the current environment variable is set to <strong>TESTSERVER</strong>. In common, the action
definition file contains the following lines:
<br />
<br />
<file:highlight name="TESTSERVER_actionconfig.ini" />
<br />
As described on the
<a href="./?Page=012-Frontcontroller" title="front controller">front controller page</a>, the section
name corresponds to the action name, the section itself defines which files contain the action and
input classes. The sixth parameter can be used to specify standard parameters for the input object.
<br />
<br />
Calling the url
<pre class="tagexample">
  /~/modules_newspager_biz-action/Pager/page/1/lang/en
</pre>
will display a XML similar to that:
<pre class="tagexample">
  &lt;news&gt;
    &lt;headline&gt;APF news&lt;/headline&gt;
    &lt;subheadline&gt;New version 1.5 available!&lt;/subheadline&gt;
    &lt;content&gt;
      We are proud to present the new version 1.5 of the adventure php framework. It includes
      bugfixes and enhancements of the front controller component and a complete review of the
      documentation plus translation of the entire documentation chapters into english language.
    &lt;/content&gt;
    &lt;newscount&gt;4&lt;/newscount&gt;
 &lt;/news&gt;
</pre>
<br />
<a name="4-3-Presentation-layer"></a><h4>4.3. Presentation layer implementation</h4>
The presentation layer faces two main issues: create the news box on page creation and provide the
necessary java script code to update the news box in AJAX style. Sensibly, we first deal with the
generation of the news box, because this can be done with standard adventure php framework
appliances. Due to the fact, that the news box is created through dynamically generated content
(here: text files), we need a document controller and a template file. The template file defines the
structure of the box according to the MVC pattern and the document controller generates the view
content using the template file definition.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name="4-3-1-Template-file"></a><h5>4.3.1. The template file</h5>
Due to the fact, that we have to display a box with three values filled in it, the template file
looks as follows:
<pre class="tagexample">
&lt;@controller
               namespace="modules::newspager::pres::documentcontroller"
               file="newspager_v1_controller"
               class="newspager_v1_controller"
@&gt;
&lt;div style="width: 300px; float: right; border: 1px dashed #777BB4; margin: 10px;"&gt;
  &lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: center; width: 15px; background-color: #777BB4; font-size: 16px;"&gt;
        &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style="width: 270px; height: 80px; padding: 2px; vertical-align: top; text-align: left;"&gt;
        &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps; font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold;"&gt;
          &lt;html:placeholder name="Headline" /&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;span style="font-size: 12px; font-style: italic;"&gt;&lt;html:placeholder name="Subheadline" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;span style="font-size: 11px;"&gt;&lt;html:placeholder name="Content" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: center; width: 15px; background-color: #777BB4; font-size: 16px;"&gt;
        &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
As the html code box shows, the template file contains a document controller specification and three
place holders to be filled with the content of the domain object.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name="4-3-2-Document-controller"></a><h5>4.3.2. The document controller</h5>
The corresponding document controller loads the <strong>newspagerContent</strong> object and filles
the place holders:
<php:highlight>
   import('modules::newspager::biz','newspagerManager');


   class newspager_v1_controller extends baseController
   {

      function newspager_v1_controller(){
      }


      function transformContent(){

         // get manager
         $nM = &$this->__getServiceObject('modules::newspager::data','newspagerManager');

         // load default news page
         $N = $nM->getNewsByPage();

         // fill place holders
         $this->setPlaceHolder('Headline',$N->get('Headline'));
         $this->setPlaceHolder('Subheadline',$N->get('Subheadline'));
         $this->setPlaceHolder('Content',$N->get('Content'));

       // end function
      }

    // end class
   }
</php:highlight>
<br />
<a name="4-3-3-JavaScript-code"></a><h5>4.3.3. The AJAX java script code</h5>
To add dynamic paging to the news box, some java script code must be added. Therefore, we add a
<pre class="tagexample">
  &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
  &lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
to the <strong>newspager.html</strong> template file. As we have learned above, the XMLHTTPRequest
object is used to send a request via java script to retrieve dynamic information from a server
script to update a page part without reloading the page. For this reason we use the following java
script function to create an instance of the XMLHTTPRequest object:
<pre class="tagexample">
   function createXMLHttpRequest(){

     if(window.ActiveXObject){

          try{
             // IE 6 and higher
             xhttp = new ActiveXObject("MSXML2.XMLHTTP");
           // end try
          }
          catch (e){

              try{
                 // IE 5
                 xhttp = new ActiveXObject("Microsoft.XMLHTTP");
               // end try
              }
              catch (e){
                 xhttp = false;
               // end catch
              }

           // end catch
          }

       // end if
      }
      else if(window.XMLHttpRequest){

          try{
             // Mozilla, Opera, Safari ...
             xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
           // end try
          }
          catch (e){
             xhttp = false;
           // end catch
          }

       // end else if
      }

    // end function
   }

   // execute createXMLHttpRequest() on window load
   window.onload = createXMLHttpRequest;
</pre>
The <strong>window.onload</strong> tells the browser to execute the
<strong>createXMLHttpRequest</strong> after having loaded the page. In order to be able to
manipulate the content of the page, we have to upgrade the template definition with
<strong>id</strong>s for each tag. So we can access each tag by using the
<pre class="tagexample">
   var dom_node = document.getElementById('dom_node_id');
</pre>
construct. Moreover, we must add an event handler to the two pager signs, so that the content of the
box can be changed. Therefore I defined two different java script functions (<strong>prev()</strong>
and <strong>next()</strong>), that wrap the functionality of getting forward or backward. Te next
code box shows the changes, we have to apply to the html code of the template file:
<pre class="tagexample">
&lt;div style="width: 300px; float: right; border: 1px dashed #777BB4; margin: 10px;"&gt;
  &lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: center; width: 15px; background-color: #777BB4; font-size: 16px;"&gt;
        &lt;span id="newspager_prev_button" style="font-weight: bold; cursor: pointer; visibility: hidden;" onclick="prev();"&gt;
          &amp;lt;
        &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style="width: 270px; height: 80px; padding: 2px; vertical-align: top; text-align: left;"&gt;
        &lt;span id="newspager_headline" style="font-variant: small-caps; font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold;"&gt;
          &lt;html:placeholder name="Headline" /&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;span id="newspager_subheadline" style="font-size: 12px; font-style: italic;"&gt;
          &lt;html:placeholder name="Subheadline" /&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;span id="newspager_content" style="font-size: 11px;"&gt;&lt;html:placeholder name="Content" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: center; width: 15px; background-color: #777BB4; font-size: 16px;"&gt;
        &lt;span id="newspager_next_button" style="font-weight: bold; cursor: pointer;" onclick="next();"&gt;
          &amp;gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
The functions mentioned above contain the following lines:
<pre class="tagexample">
   function next(){

      // check if XMLHTTPRequest object is initialized correctly
      if(!xhttp){
         alert("An Error occured when trying to initialize the XMLHttpRequest object!");
         return;
       // end if
      }

      // increment page number
      pagenumber = pagenumber + 1;

      // create request
      var request = "/~/modules_newspager_biz-action/Pager/page/" + pagenumber + "/lang/" + language;

      // send request for next news
      xhttp.open("GET",request,true);
      xhttp.onreadystatechange = updateNewsContent;
      xhttp.send(null);

    // end function
   }

   function prev(){

      // check if XMLHTTPRequest object is initialized correctly
      if(!xhttp){
         alert("An Error occured when trying to initialize the XMLHttpRequest object!");
         return;
       // end if
      }

      // decrement page number
      pagenumber = pagenumber - 1;

      // create request
      var request = "/~/modules_newspager_biz-action/Pager/page/" + pagenumber + "/lang/" + language;

      // send request for next or prev news page
      xhttp.open("GET",request,true);
      xhttp.onreadystatechange = updateNewsContent;
      xhttp.send(null);

    // end function
   }
</pre>
First of all, each function checks, wheather the XMLHTTPRequest object was created successfully.
Second, the page number is either incremented or decremented to indicate the page number to load.
After that, the front controller style request is constructed. Due to the fact, that xml http
requests only can be done for the same domain, the page is delivered, we can define the url string
relatively. The last code block then opens the defined url for a GET request, defines a event handler
for the <strong>readystatechange</strong> event and sends the request.
<br />
<br />
Some of you now may say, that the function definition should be more generic. The answer is: yes, it
may. But this example is there to demonstrate the way of how you can add AJAX support to your
application. As this module is quite simple, complexity drastically raises, when implementing more
substantial applications.
<br />
<br />
Let's now discuss the event handler function for updating the content view of the news box. This
method has two main tasks to execute: display the content of the XMLHTTPRequest request and control
the pager arrows, when the maximum or minimum number of pages has been reached. To do so, we have
to create the following java script code:
<pre class="tagexample">
   function updateNewsContent() {

      // check for ready loadad and HTTP status 200 (OK)
      if(xhttp.readyState == 4 && xhttp.status == 200){

         // get request xml
         var responseXML = xhttp.responseXML;

         // insert xml values into the desired spans
         var headline = responseXML.getElementsByTagName('news').item(0).childNodes[0].textContent;
         document.getElementById("newspager_headline").innerHTML = headline;

         var subheadline = responseXML.getElementsByTagName('news').item(0).childNodes[1].textContent;
         document.getElementById("newspager_subheadline").innerHTML = subheadline;

         var content = responseXML.getElementsByTagName('news').item(0).childNodes[2].textContent;
         document.getElementById("newspager_content").innerHTML = content;

         // extract news count out of the xml
         var newscount = responseXML.getElementsByTagName('news').item(0).childNodes[3].textContent;

         // enable prev and next button by default
         document.getElementById("newspager_prev_button").style.visibility = "visible";
         document.getElementById("newspager_next_button").style.visibility = "visible";

         // disable next button if desired
         if(pagenumber >= newscount){
            document.getElementById("newspager_next_button").style.visibility = "hidden";
          // end if
         }

         // disable prev button if desired
         if(pagenumber <= 1){
            document.getElementById("newspager_prev_button").style.visibility = "hidden";
            pagenumber = 1;
          // end if
         }

       // end if
      }
</pre>
As you can see in line 4, the function waits for the request being completed. If this is the case,
the content of the request is read from the xhttp object created before. The
<strong>responseXML</strong> attribute contains a <strong>DOM document</strong>, that can be accessed
via java script functions. The second code block updates the spans addressed by the given DOM ids.
To be able to control the pager buttons, we have to know the maximum number of pages and the current
page number. For this reason the news count is initially filled and is included in each response.
The initialisation of the <strong>newscount</strong> value is simply done by adding the declaration
block
<pre class="tagexample">
   // declare variable to be initialized with the XMLHttpRequest object
   var xhttp;

   // declare current page number
   var pagenumber = 1;

   // declace news count
   var newscount = &lt;html:placeholder name="NewsCount" /&gt;;

   // declare current language
   var language = "&lt;html:placeholder name="NewsLanguage" /&gt;";
</pre>
to the java script code and fill the place holders by append the following php code to the document
controller:
<php:highlight>
   $this->setPlaceHolder('NewsLanguage',$this->__Language);
   $this->setPlaceHolder('NewsCount',$N->get('NewsCount'));
</php:highlight>

This chapter is intended to list the pitfalls, that can appear during AJAX application development.
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Apache answers request with a 404 error page:</strong>
    <br />
    If you write any application, that saves data in your data base using an AJAX request, it is
    recommended to encode your form data using the <strong>encodeURIComponent()</strong> function.
    Doing so, also slashes and backslashes are encoded. If your server side AJAX component is a
    front controller action, that is requested by a url rewrited url string, having encoded slashes
    or backslashes will result in a 404 error code. The problem is, that the apache webserver
    decodes the slashes and thus creates a wrong url.
    <br />
    <br />
    The solution is quite easy: you just have to add the directive
    <pre class="tagexample">AllowEncodedSlashes On</pre>
    to your VHOST configuration. This apache bug cost me three days to find!
    <br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Degugging tools:</strong>
    <br />
    Unfortunately only the firefox browser contains a powerful debugging and analyzing tool
    (firebug), that really helps tracing your application. Opera features a firefox-like toolbar,
    but the functionality is less. For the internet explorer I have not found any equivalent product
    to be able to see the browser objects (especially the content of the <strong>xhttp</strong>
    variable). The IE toolbar only has a DOM tree browser and some other useful features.
    <br />
    <br />
    Due to this fact, I was not able to get the news box application running on IE browsers. Perhaps
    someone could give me advive. Please refer to the following thread, that contains a description:
    <doku:link>http://www.phpfriend.de/forum/ftopic63486.html</doku:link>.
    <br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Character encoding issues:</strong>
    <br />
    As I mentioned during tests with user input data, firefox and opera send data in UTF-8 format to
    the server although the page is delivered in ISO-8859-1 encoding. This leads to the problem,
    that data, that is sent back to the browser is encoded with the wrong character set. To solve
    this, the data must be translated into the target charset using <strong>utf8_decode()</strong>.
    <br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Implementation review:</strong>
    <br />
    In my opinion it is much more complex to build AJAX applications from the scratch, because you
    are forced to implement all the features you have included in a server side php framework like
    the adventure php framework once more. Otherwise you are getting crazy with all that
    <pre class="tagexample">document.getElementById()</pre> or
    <pre class="tagexample">foo.innerHTML = bar</pre>
    So adding AJAX features to your application means, that you have to think very carefully about
    your application or module design. I even claim, that writing AJAX applications needs much more
    understanding of good application design. Otherwise, this leads to bad software architecture!
