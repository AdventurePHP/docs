The present chapter explains important classes of the frameworks and defines the intent. It goes into
the internal design of the frameworks and the document object model (DOM) defined there. The class
definitions are avaliable under <a href="./?Page=002-API-Documentation" title="API documentation">API documentation</a>
in CHM files or ZIP files with plain HTML files.

<a name="1-Central-basic-classes"></a><h3>1. Central basic classes of the framework</h3>
All classes in the folder "core" are important classes to the framework. These were structured in
the folder "core", because the author assumes that these are necessary for building an application
based on this framework. The following chapters discuss the most important and most often used classes
and their intent.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name="1-1-coreObject"></a><h4>1.1. coreObject</h4>
The class <em>coreObject</em> forms the very central class. Normally every class inherits from this
base class. It defines attributes and methodes used in concrete implementations of this interface.
<em>coreObject</em> is not only a base class to presentation layer classes but also to classes that
are residing in the business or data layer. This has the advantage that many parts of the
applications can be standardised. The private attributes define basic qualities of an object and
allow object trees to be based by father-to-child relations. With the public methods the attributes
and properties can be manipulated. The private methods are service methods which apply in the
implementings of <em>coreObject()</em>. Examples for existing service methodes can be found on the
<a href="./?Page=033-Configuration" title="configuration">configuration page</a>.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name="1-2-Document"></a><h4>1.2. Document</h4>
<em>Document</em> inherits from <em>coreObject</em> and plays a central role for presentation layer
classes only. This class features a variety of parser methodes that generate object trees out of XML
code and generates HTML code out of an given object tree with help of the <em>transform()</em> method.
Every XML taglib must inherit from the <em>Document</em> class to be able to use it's attributes and
methodes. The UML diagram can be seen under <a href="./?Page=002-API-Documentation" title="API dokumentation">API dokumentation</a>
The developer does not get into contact with the class <em>Document</em> within
<a href="./?Page=047-Templates" title="templates">template construction</a> at first, nevertheless, the
definition of the class will get interesting with the construction of own
<a href="./?Page=045-User-specific-taglibs" title="create taglibs">taglibs</a>, because all tree nodes must
inherit from <em>Document</em> to specialize the functionality of the tag.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name="1-3-Page"></a><h4>1.3. Page</h4>
The class <em>Page</em> encases a complete web page with it's internal tree structure. It finds use
in the index files and implements a variety of methods for the URL rewriting feature.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name="1-4-baseController"></a><h4>1.4. baseController</h4>
The class <em>baseController</em> is the central interface for all DocumentController according to
the MVC approach. It describes which methods of the DocumentController must be implemented and which
attributes of a Documents are available within the controller. Further details to controllers can be
read up <a href="./?Page=006-Controller" title="controller">here</a>. To insert dynamic contents in
documents the method "transformContent()" must be implemented in the derived controller classes. It
is executed while transforming a tree node and the content is afterwards implanted in the contents
of the node. Thus it is possible, for example, to print out the text "<code>hello world!</code>"
with respect to the browser language.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name="1-5-Singleton"></a><h4>1.5. Singleton</h4>
A very often used component is the singleton implementation. The implementation contained in the
framework is an <strong>abstract singleton</strong> class. With this it is possible to generate any
class as a singleton object in the application. A requirement is that the constructor expects no
duty parameters. For design and performance reasons nearly all services are used in "singleton" style.
This means that "services" that used during a requests exist exactly <strong>once</strong>. This
pattern is mainly used for all the services generated with the <em>__getServiceObject()</em> and
<em>__getAndInitServiceObject()</em> methods. An often appearing application case of singleton is
the benchmarker.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name="1-6-benchmarkTimer"></a><h4>1.6. benchmarkTimer</h4>
The <em>benchmarkTimer</em> is other important component. With this it is possible to gather the execution
times of different parts of the software and to generate a report from it. Thus performance-weak
points can be found out and execution times be measured. Details to <em>benchmarkTimer</em> can be
read up <a href="./?Page=004-Benchmark" title="benchmark">here</a>.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name="2-GUI-DOM-model"></a><h3>2. DOM object model of the presentation layer</h3>
With the contained page controller the framework owns a GUI controller who abstracts the complete
GUI of a site into an own internal document object tree. Besides, every node is represented by an
object which inherits from the class <em>Document</em>. Thus it is made sure according to the composite
pattern that the object tree can be extended at any place. One single tree element is represented by
a view and a controller concerning the MVC pattern. The model - here one speaks of "model" in terms
of internals like expiries and status information, not from "model" for the purposes of a domain
object - often is included in the controller, a business component or an extra model class. The view
is represented by a template file in the present implementation and the controller is a DocumentController,
inheriting from the class <em>baseController</em>.
<br />
<br />
The page controller features the central parser methode <strong>__extractTagLibTags()</strong> which
is used to create tree nodes (child nodes of the current node) by parsing known tags in template files.
The functionality of a single DOM node is represented by a taglib class that inherits from the
<em>Document</em> class. Each node has a set of known taglibs, that can be expanded by adding specific
XML tags to a given template file. The documentation of these taglibs can be found on the
<a href="./?Page=046-Standard-TagLibs" title="standard taglibs">standard taglib page</a>.
<br />
<br />
If one analyzes the templates and controllers of the topical documentation web page, the following
internal DOM object structure arises after the parsing of the templates:
<br />
<br />
<center>
  <img src="/frontend/media/DOM_Tree.png" border="0" alt="Adventure php framework DOM object tree" />
</center>
<br />
<br />
The DOM definition of the frameworks assumes from the fact that the structure of a site is encapsulated
in an object of the class <em>Page</em>. That means that the object of the class <em>Page</em> forms
the root node. Within this root node a initial <em>Document</em> node is created to load the
initial template. The known tags of this template are examined by the page controller and new child
nodes are created from them.
<br />
<br />
In general, <strong>&lt;core:importdesign /&gt;</strong> tags are used to include the templates defined
with the tag's attributes as a new child node in the existing DOM structure. Doing so, is possible
to generate and to administer an arbitrarily deep tree structure. This is handy particularly in big
web pages with meny views. Details on the <strong>&lt;core:importdesign /&gt;</strong> tag can be
taken from the
<a href="./?Page=046-Standard-taglibs#1-2-Importdesign" title="Standard taglibs">standard taglibs page</a>.
