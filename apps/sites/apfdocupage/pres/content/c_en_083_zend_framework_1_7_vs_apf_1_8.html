Do you also think, that the article
<a href="http://de.adventure-php-framework.org/Seite/049-PHP-Frameworks-im-Test" title="PHP-Frameworks im Test (german)">PHP-Frameworks im Test</a>
(german) written in 2007 is quite old? Is this test not representitive any more due to the new
functionality and improvements released in the meantime?
<br />
<br />
We thought so, too! And because of leck of time, we just pimped the source code of the test done last
year and initiated a performance challenge between the zend framework (ZF) and the adventure php
framework (APF). We also included new functionality, if applicable.

As you can take from the article mentioned above, the test comprehended the rendering of a four-area
webpage with one main template including the page's meta tags, two menus and one content area. The
content of the content area is stored in a file. The two menus just contain static link lists.

As a second test, form handling was checked using a simple contact form. This is intended to measure
the performance while processing a greater amount of objects. Thereby, the form consists of four text
and on select field with value presetting and field validation on button click. If the fields are
not filled with valid content, a validation hint is displayed as shown on the next screen.

<a name="2-Test-results"></a><h3>2. Test results</h3>
The execution time was recorded by a quick & dirty
<pre class="tagexample">
for i in $(seq 1 10)
do
   wget -o result.txt http://local.test.url
   grep -i "&nbsp;s&nbsp;" result.txt | head -1 | cut -d "&gt;" -f 2 |  cut -d "&" -f 1 >> local.test.url.log
   sleep 10
done
</pre>
script. To ensure comparability, the test machine was not executing any other software except the
webserver and the shell script. As we wanted to test the pure uncached performance, tools like
mmcache or eaccelerator were not used. The following image presents the benchmark results to you:

<br />
<br />
As the result table shows, the zend framework is 4 times slower than the adventure php framework when
rendering normal pages. The factor is reduced to 2 times, when handling a large amount of objects.
<br />
<br />
Due to the performance enhancements planned for the 1.7 series of the zend framework, the result was
a little bit confusing. We would have expected greater performance of the zend framework, but the
APF is still better in rendering complex web pages. With respect to the greater complexity of the
DOM object tree created by the APF, the result of the ZF is disappointing.
