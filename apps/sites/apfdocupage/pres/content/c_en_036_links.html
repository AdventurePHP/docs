  The framework features two dedicated components to dynamically generate urls. The LinkHandler and
  FrontcontrollerLinkHandler classes both can generate new urls or manipulate.

The generation of links or URLs is as old as the history of the dynamic web applications themselves.
The requirement for such a tool is easy compared with the complexity of the implemention:
<strong>manipulate existing URLs to generate new ones</strong>. This functionality is included in the
<strong>LinkHandler</strong> component of the adventure php framework. The class gives the opportunity to
deal with URLs and alter or delete their paramaters.
<br />
<br />
The following example shows the case of generating a link for a button in the guestbook application
included in this page. There a basic URL taken from the $_SERVER array is processed by the
<strong>generateLink</strong> method. The second parameter of the <strong>LinkHandler</strong>'s
function indicates the parts of the URL that should be added or replaced by the given key-value-array.
The source code of your application may therefore contain the following lines:
<php:highlight>
   $EntryID = '4711';
   echo LinkHandler::generateLink(
                                  $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'],
                                  array(
                                        'view' => 'deleteentry',
                                        'entryid' => $EntryID,
                                        'action' => ''
                                        )
                                  );
</php:highlight>
In this example the resulting URL will contain the parameter <strong>view</strong> with the value
<strong>deleteentry</strong> and <strong>entryid</strong> with the value <strong>4711</strong>. The
parameter <strong>action</strong> is deleted from the URL whatever the parameter was included in the
basic URL or not.

<br />
To use the <strong>LinkHandler</strong> component it must be imported using the
<php:highlight>
   import('tools::link','LinkHandler');
</php:highlight>
code fragment. Due to the fact, that this class is a static class, it can be used anywhere.

<br />
For the generation of front controller compilant URLs, the <strong>FrontcontrollerLinkHandler</strong>
component was introduced. For details concerning this class please refer to the
