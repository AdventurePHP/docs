The api documentation of the Adventure-PHP-Framework is available in two different flavours: online
and offline documentation. The docs are generated by doxygen
(<a href="http://doxygen.org" target="_blank">http://doxygen.org</a>) featuring graphviz
(<a href="http://www.graphviz.org/" target="_blank">http://www.graphviz.org/</a>) and there are
pure html or chm documentation files.
<br />
Due to changes in release management, the api documentation was moved to the download page and
bundled with every release available. This procedure guaranteed, that each version of the framework
is well documented. Below, you can find a list of available online api documentatons. The entire
documentations can be found on the
<a href="./?Page=008-Downloads" title="Downloads">download page</a> together with the desired release.
