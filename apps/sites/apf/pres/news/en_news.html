   <h3><int:link pageid="008">Version 1.14 (stable) released!</int:link></h3>
   <div class="date">Saturday, 18th of October 2011</div>
   <p>
      The APF team is proud to announce the stable release of version 1.14.
   </p>
   <p>
      This version contains all features described on the
      <a class="wiki" href="http://wiki.adventure-php-framework.org/de/Roadmap#Version_1.14" title="Roadmap">roadmap</a>.
   </p>
   <p>
      The major feature changes are:
   </p>
   <ul>
      <li>
         Re-design and optimization of the link generation and url abstraction. This change enables you in combination
         with the input and output filters to change the url layout without code changes.
      </li>
      <li>
         Input and output filter are now executed with a filter chain. This allows multiple filter execution during one
         request as well as adding or removing filters on runtime.
      </li>
      <li>
         The <em>usermanagement</em> module was added a generic login functionality that can be added to any kind of
         application without code changes. Further, the module now saves password data in a more secure way using static
         and user-dependent dynamic salts.
      </li>
      <li>
         The famous o/r mapper of the APF has been added domain object handling. This feature supports the implementation
         according to the <em>domain object</em> software design pattern. Moreover, the update tool and the query facade
         <em>GenericCriterionObject</em> have been enhanced.
      </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
      All features within this release can be taken from the
      <a class="wiki" href="http://wiki.adventure-php-framework.org/de/Roadmap#Version_1.14">Roadmap</a> (German).

   <div class="date">Sunday, 31st of Januar 2010</div>
   <p>
      The APF team is proud to announce the new website together with the 1.11 stable release.
   </p>
   <p>
      Revision 1.11 comes up with a revised version of the <int:link pageid="113">form support</int:link>
      on the basis of taglibs. Now generic definition of validators and filters on the basis of the 
      observer pattern is supported and forms can be easier adjusted to own needs.
   </p>
   <p>
      The OR mapper <int:link pageid="063">GenericORMapper</int:link>, already added in the release
      1.9, was extended with tools to <int:link pageid="063" anchor="Chapter-3-Database-setup">automatically setup</int:link>
      and <int:link pageid="128">update a database</int:link>. Now the developer can completely
      concentrate on the development of the logic of the application since the storage of the
      objects is completely managed by the mapper.
   </p>
   <p>
      Part of the release's performance optimization were optimizations in the core of the
      frameworks and the rework of the integrated <int:link pageid="004">BenchmarkTimer</int:link>.
      It now supplies the developer with a better graphical representation of the measurements to
      find hot spots within an application. Thus an application can be optimally prepared for operation.
   </p>
   <p>
      With release of version 1.11 the support for PHP 4 has been announced for discontinuation and the
      compatibility with PHP 5.3 has been improved. The coming version 1.12 will focus on the extension
      of the new form support and the rework of the configuration component.

   <p>
      The APF team is proud to announce the stable release of the 1.10 series. Within this
      maintenance release, development entirely switched to PHP5. A compatibility version for PHP4 will
      be available since the beginning of 2010. Beneath some clean-ups and refactorings , several
      performance optimization tasks guarantee excellent performance. The probably biggest technical
      innovation is the introduction of the "dependency injection container" similar to the objection
      initialization of SPRING (JAVA). Further, this release contains many features, that were discussed
      in the developer forum to be included.
   </p>
   <p>
      Morover, the final release of the 1.10 branch contains all changes concerning the feedback on the
      two release candidates.
