<doku:title parent="118" tags="bugtracking,bug,report,forum" title="Bugtracking" urlname="Bugtracking">
  Bug reports are currently addressed within the forum, because the APF does not have an explicit
  bugtracking tool at the moment.
</doku:title>
<p>
   Due to the fact, that there is no a TRAC or JIRA installation available at the moment, bugtracking
   was transferred to the forum. The section <strong>Bugtracking</strong> was introduced to give the
   opportunity to report or search for bugs. Please refer to the
   <a class="forum" href="http://forum.adventure-php-framework.org/viewforum.php?f=8" linkrewrite="false" title="APF support forum">APF support forum</a>
   for more details. Note, that the current entries are in German language only, but do you have the
   possibility to post reports in English language as well.
