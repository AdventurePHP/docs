  Bug reports are currently addressed within the forum, because the APF does not have an explicit
  bugtracking tool at the moment.
</doku:title>
Due to the fact, that there is no a TRAC or JIRA installation available at the moment, bugtracking
was transfered to the forum. The section <strong>Bugtracking</strong> was introduced to give the
opportunity to report or search for bugs. Please refer to the
<a class="forum" href="http://forum.adventure-php-framework.org/en/viewforum.php?f=9" linkrewrite="false" title="APF english language support forum">english language APF support forum</a>
for more details. Note, that the current entries are in German language only, but do you have the
possibility to post reports in englisch language as well.
