   <h3>Version 1.10 (stable) released!</h3>
   <div class="date">04.09.2009</div>
   <p>
      The APF team is proud to anounce the stable release of the 1.10 series. Within this
      maintenance release, development entirely switched to PHP5. A compatibility version for PHP4 will
      be available since the beginning of 2010. Beneath some clean-ups and refactorings , several
      performance optimization tasks guarantee excellent performance. The probably biggest technical
      innovation is the introduction of the "dependency injection container" similar to the objection
      initialization of SPRING (JAVA). Further, this release contains many features, that were discussed
      in the developer forum to be included.
   </p>
   <p>
      Morover, the final release of the 1.10 branch contains all changes concerning the feedback on the
      two release candidates.
