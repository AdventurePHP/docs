      <strong>Ralf Schubert</strong>, an enthusiastic APF developer likes the framework giving the chance
      to easily develop resuable gui elements (aka. widgets). To support beginners, he wrote this article
      to give a brief introduction into the framework and to ease the first steps using the APF.

      As of today, the APF can be installed and distributed on RedHat based LINUX distributions using
      RPM packages. Reiner Rottmann has therefor created a new YUM channel, that serves the APF demo
      application as well as the sample config files, the code package and the API documentation.

   <h3>Version 1.10 (stable) released!</h3>
   <div class="date">Sunday, 04th of September 2009</div>
   <p>
      The APF team is proud to anounce the stable release of the 1.10 series. Within this
      maintenance release, development entirely switched to PHP5. A compatibility version for PHP4 will
      be available since the beginning of 2010. Beneath some clean-ups and refactorings , several
      performance optimization tasks guarantee excellent performance. The probably biggest technical
      innovation is the introduction of the "dependency injection container" similar to the objection
      initialization of SPRING (JAVA). Further, this release contains many features, that were discussed
      in the developer forum to be included.
   </p>
   <p>
      Morover, the final release of the 1.10 branch contains all changes concerning the feedback on the
      two release candidates.
