  The genericormapper module provides a generic data mapper, that is fully integrated into the APF.
  It enables the developer to dynamically handle objects and their reations, that are defined within
  configuration files. This page especially describes some permormance hacks, that can make slow
  queries faster and thus accelerate data layers.

The OR mapper basically is implemented for best performance, but due to bad design of the data model
sometimes, performance hacks could be necessary. The following chapter describes examples, where
manual interaction into the mapper layer or the usage of the mapper has good impact on the
performance.

In case of frequent table access via attributes in WHERE clauses it could be helpful to add an index
to the relevant columns.

If there is no reason why, the mapper should be created in <strong>SESSIONSINGLETON</strong> mode.
This brings the advantage, that the mapping and relation table is parsed only one time within a
session. This activity gains the performance up to 10% on every further call of the application. The
following lines of code show how to create the mapper in <strong>SESSIONSINGLETON</strong> mode:
<gen:highlight type="php">
// get the mapper factory
$ORMFactory = $this->__getServiceObject('modules::genericormapper::data','GenericORMapperFactory');

// create the mapper
$ORM = &$ORMFactory->getGenericORMapper(
                                        '{NAMESPACE}',
                                        '{NAMEAFFIX}',
                                        '{CONNECTIONKEY}',
                                        'SESSIONSINGLETON' // <-- Indicates SESSIONSINGLETON mode
                                       );
</gen:highlight>

<h4 id="Chapter-2-3-JOIN-optimization"><a href="#Chapter-2-3-JOIN-optimization">2.3. JOIN optimization</a></h4>
If you have a huge amount of data and you often have to query complex object relations, it is
recommended to write the JOIN conditions within the statements yourself. Thereby, you can take care,
that the JOIN conditions, that are more selective are placed in the front of not-so-selective
conditions. This method can positively influence the execution time.
