            The Adventure PHP Framework (APF) includes a strong kernel. Based on the
            <int:link pageid="098" />, the framework can be adapted to you needs very easily. Further,
            the core-supporting components are helping you to let efficient development happen.

            In our opinion, performance is an important issue! To ensure this, the APF kernel is designed
            for maximum performance. Thus, the APF winns the <int:link pageid="103">RPS-Benchmark</int:link>!

            Driven by the community and the APF developers, each release contains new features
            that make web application development a pleasure even more. The
            <a class="wiki" href="http://wiki.adventure-php-framework.org/de/Roadmap" title="Roadmap">Roadmap</a>
            describes the technical innovations that will be included in the next releases.

   <h3 class="dontsHeadline">What is the Adventure PHP Framework not?</h3>

   <dl class="donts">
      <dt>All over solution</dt>
      <dd>
         <p>
            The APF is a web application development framework supporting to create individual
            solutions. It is not an all over solution that must be installed and configures like
            a CMS or a similar application.
         </p>
         <p>
            Nevertheless the framework includes several
            <int:link pageid="119" anchor="Modules">modules</int:link> that are intended to be
            directle be included in your applications.
         </p>
      </dd>

      <dt>Guarantee</dt>
      <dd>
         <p>
            Using the APF does not mean, that your application automatically is modern, reusable
            and fast by design! You nonetheless have to be willing to create a well designed
            software solution.
         </p>
         <p>
            But the good news is, that the framework does support you to create applications by
            using
            <int:link pageid="013" title="Basics of the APF">established design patterns</int:link>.

      <dd>
         <p>
            The APF contains no tools for automativ code generation. We thing this is a conceptual
            failure that leads to code that is only maintainable having high costs or is not
            servicable at all.
         </p>
         <p>
            Concerning the database the APF contains the <int:link pageid="063" /> which is a 
            tool that completely abstracts O/R mapping. Thus you do not need to write
            &quot;hyperintelligent&quot; model classes.
