  listed.

<h3 id="Chapter-1-Introduction"><a href="#Chapter-1-Introduction">1. Introduction</a></h3>
One of the most popular implementation examples on the web is a Blog. Usually, the blog described in
those tutorials is kept very easy, to show how easy it is to implement a Blog with the product presented
there. In fact, a Blog is nothing easy, but a complex tool, that can handle several use cases and many data.
<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, it is hard to find good tutorial topics, so the APF page now features a Blog tutorial,
too. :)
<br />

<h3 id="Chapter-2-Preparation"><a href="#Chapter-2-Preparation">2. Preparation</a></h3>
Let us at first have a look at the requirements of a blog. Usually a Blog has four different data
objects, that must be handled: posts, categories, tags and comments. As an extended feature, a
navigation can be added for structuring the Blog page. For security reasons, the blog should have a
user management.
<br />
<br />
As you can see by the last few lines, Blogs are nothing that can be implemented within a 5 minute
tutorial. Due to this fact, the tutorial is splitted into several parts: a quickstart, that describes
the basics of the Blog and further chapters, that teach you how to implement navigation and user
management.

<h3 id="Chapter-3-Requirements"><a href="#Chapter-3-Requirements">3. Requirements</a></h3>
<h4 id="Chapter-3-1-Use-cases"><a href="#Chapter-3-1-Use-cases">3.1. Use cases</a></h4>
Too keep thing simple - as we know, in reality they are not ;) - this part of the tutorial is
restricted to the following use cases:
<br />
<br />
<img src="http://media.adventure-php-framework.org/content/Blog_Use_Case_Model.png" alt="Blog use case model" />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<h4 id="Chapter-3-2-Data-model"><a href="#Chapter-3-2-Data-model">3.2. Data model</a></h4>
To represent these use cases, the data model should look like this:
<br />
<br />
<img src="http://media.adventure-php-framework.org/content/Simple_Blog_Data_Model.png" alt="Simple Blog data model" />
<br />
<br />
The <em>Post</em> object is the central object of the data model. It composes <em>Comment</em>s and
has associations to the <em>Category</em> and <em>Tag</em> objects. The relations have been choosen
like this, because a <em>Comment</em> object cannot exist without a <em>Post</em>. Instead, a
<em>Tag</em> or <em>Category</em> can. The object and relation names are used later on, so keep them
in mind.
<br />

<h3 id="Chapter-4-Implementation"><a href="#Chapter-4-Implementation">4. Implementation</a></h3>
As you may have read in other APF tutorials sometimes it is good to start with te data layer
implementation and in other cases it is comfortable to first create the presentation layer. In case
of the blog, let's start with the data layer.
<br />
<br />
Please note, that the adventure php framework does <strong>not</strong> feature a build tool, that
generates the skeletons for you. We consciously abstain from that, because we think that this is too
<strong>intransparent</strong>!
<br />
<br />
<br />
<h4 id="Chapter-4-1-Data-layer"><a href="#Chapter-4-1-Data-layer">4.1. Data layer</a></h4>
Due to the demand, that the data layer implementation should be kept simple, the
<a href="./?Page=063-Generic-OR-mapper" title="Generic OR mapper">Generic OR mapper</a> is used. This
module provides a reusable data laser component, that can handle all data models defined by some
configuration files.
<br />
<br />
As described in the
<a href="./?Page=063-Generic-OR-mapper#Chapter-2-3-1-Object-definition" title="Object definition">object definition</a>
chapter, each object must be defined within one configuration section. The following code box shows
the configuration of the data model depicted above:
<gen:highlight type="ini">
[Post]
Title = "VARCHAR(100)"
Teaser = "VARCHAR(200)"
Content = "TEXT"

[Category]
Name = "VARCHAR(100)"
Description = "TEXT"

[Tag]
Name = "VARCHAR(100)"

[Comment]
Title = "VARCHAR(100)"
Content = "TEXT"
Author = "VARCHAR(100)"
EMail = "VARCHAR(200)"
</gen:highlight>
Further, the relations contained in the UML diagram must be defined in the relation definition file.
This looks as follows:
<gen:highlight type="ini">
[Category2Post]
Type = "ASSOCIATION"
SourceObject = "Category"
TargetObject = "Post"

[Tag2Post]
Type = "ASSOCIATION"
SourceObject = "Tag"
TargetObject = "Post"

[Post2Comment]
Type = "COMPOSITION"
SourceObject = "Post"
TargetObject = "Comment"
</gen:highlight>
In order to use the generic or mapper, the object and relation configuration must be stored in two
configuration files.
