   need and to be able to react as fast as you'd expect them to do.

<h3>Where to report a bug</h3>
Due to the fact, that the APF does not have any specialized bug reporting tool, bugs have to be
reported as a forum thread. For this reason, please visit the
<a class="forum" href="http://forum.adventure-php-framework.org/de/viewforum.php?f=8" title="German bug report forum" linkrewrite="false">German language</a>
or the 
<a class="forum" href="http://forum.adventure-php-framework.org/en/viewforum.php?f=9" title="English bug report forum" linkrewrite="false">English language</a>
bug report forum and create a new thread. But be aware of the subsequent sentences!

<h3>Search the existing bug reports first!</h3>
Read the documentation carefully and always search the bug database first. This avoids duplicate
bug reports and helps us to save time spent on analyzing duplicate reports.

<h3>Try the current SVN version</h3>
If applicable, please try to use a current version from the SVN. Probably, the bug has already been
fixed. For detailed instructions on how to obtain a copy from the svn, please refer to
<int:link pageid="068" />.

<h3>The basics: what you did, what you wanted to happen, and what actually happened.</h3>
Those three elements are the basics for all bug reports. It is important to tell us, what you have
tried to do (e.g. include taglib within a template) and what actually happend (e.g. taglib was not
executed). The better the description, the faster the problem could be analyzed and a bugfix could
be created.
<br />

<h3>What must be included in a bug report</h3>
A good bug report contains the following parts:
<ul>
   <li>A summary of the actual problem to give information about the context of your work.</li>
   <li>A couple of sentences describing, what you did, what you wanted to happen, and what actually happened.</li>
   <li>A code sample enabling a developer to reproduce the bug.</li>
</ul>
In case, these things are present, we are sure to be able to provide a quick bugfix - in case it is
a true bug. ;)
