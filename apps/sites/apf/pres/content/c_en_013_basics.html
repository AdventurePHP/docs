  The present chapter procures the basics of the framework. First of all, the architecture and the
  patterns used are described, after that the source code structure, issues like templating and
  basic configuration are addressed.

<h3 id="Chapter-1-Introduction"><a href="#Chapter-1-Introduction">1. Introduction</a></h3>
<p>
   The Adventure PHP Framework gets on as an aid for the implementation of object orientated,
   generic and reusable PHP applications. Various OO design pattern and a set of coding conventions
   offer solutions for known problems.
</p>
<p>
   Hence, the framework is a programmer's help and <strong>not</strong> a ready-to-install
   application which merely must be configured. The design of the software can only be created by 
   the developer itself and the framework can only support the implementation!
</p>

<h3 id="Chapter-2-Structure-and-meaning-of-folders"><a href="#Chapter-2-Structure-and-meaning-of-folders">2. Structure and meaning of the folders</a></h3>
<p>
   As a common practice in the object orientated world, the components of the framework are stored in
   folders concerning their dependencies and importance. Here the folder defines the name of the package
   and the file name the name of the class. The components nedded within a program part can be included
   by the <strong>import()</strong> function.
</p>
<p>
   Each release version possesses the following folder structure:
</p>
<gen:highlight type="code">
apps/ (<em>Directory for all source code files</em>)
     [config/ (<em>Directory for all configuration files</em>)]

     core/ (<em>Directory that contains the core components</em>)
          benchmark/
          configuration/
          database/
          errorhandler/
          filesystem/
          filter/
          frontcontroller/
          logging/
          pagecontroller/
          service/
          session/
          singleton/

     modules/ (<em>Directory that contains the modules shipped with each release</em>)
             comments/
             guestbook/
             kontakt4/
             pager/
             socialbookmark/

     [sites/ (<em>E.g. directory for the source code files of a project</em>)]

     tools/ (<em>Directory including the tools</em>)
           cache/
           datetime/
           form/
                taglib/
           html/
                taglib/
           image/
           link/
           mail/
           string/
           validator/
           variablen/
</gen:highlight>
<p>
   The folders <em>core</em> and <em>tools</em> contain core components of the
   framework and are delivered with every release. In it are among other things the implementing of
   the page controller (<em>/apps/core/pagecontroller/</em>), the <em>ConfigurationManager</em>
   (<em>/apps/core/configuration/</em>) or tools like the <em>ImageManager</em> (<em>/apps/tools/image/</em>)
   and the <em>LinkGenerator</em> (<em>/apps/tools/link/</em>).
</p>
<p>
   The <em>modules</em> folder contains modules based on the <em>core</em> and
   <em>tools</em> components that are delivered with each release (e.g. guestbook, contact form).
   You can use them to enrich your web page or application.
</p>
<p>
   Below <em>config</em> the configuration files which are used in core components or parts of
   your software are held. This can be language mapping files, configuration files for your applications
   or MySQL statement files.
</p>
<p>
   Because it is a significant point of the paradigms of the framework to always create reusable code
   parts, it is distinguished between the folders <em>modules</em> and <em>sites</em>.
   The folder <em>modules</em> contains every software part, that can be included in real web
   projects hosted under the folder <em>sites</em>. A web page project can be not only an easy
   web page, but also a complicated project as for example a CMS.
</p>
<p>
   The precise contents of the folders can be seen in the <int:link pageid="002" />.
</p>

<h3 id="Chapter-3-Easy-application"><a href="#Chapter-3-Easy-application">3. Construction of an easy application</a></h3>
<p>
   The framework is written to operate in a so-called <em>post-back mode</em>. This means, that
   a web site project consists of exactly one central file (often called "bootstrap file"). This file
   must be configured as an DirectoryIndex within the web server's configuration. Nevertheless, it
   is possible - and often also helpfully - to define other central files according to their task.
   But it had proved satisfactory to deal with only one bootstrap file, because of the lower maintenance
   costs.
</p>
<div class="hint">
   As a start the <int:link pageid="111" /> tutorial is recommended.
</div>

<h4 id="Chapter-3-1-Bootstrap-file"><a href="#Chapter-3-1-Bootstrap-file">3.1. Schema of an index.php file</a></h4>
<p>
   A simple application merely consists of a bootstrap file and a master template. The index.php loads
   the template, therefrom creates a page, that is transformed and displayed afterwards. The master
   template defines the structure of the application and indicates, which further taglibs or modules are
   included.
</p>
<p>
   A typical <em>index.php</em> has the following code parts:
</p>
<gen:highlight type="php">
// include the page controller (APF core library)
include_once('./apps/core/pagecontroller/pagecontroller.php');

// include the front controller
import('core::frontcontroller', 'Frontcontroller');

// create and configure front controller
$fC = &Singleton::getInstance('Frontcontroller');
$fC->setContext('{1}');
// optional: $fC->setLanguage('{2}');

// start request processing and send result to the client
echo $fC->start('{3}', '{4}');
</gen:highlight>
The place holders marked with <strong>{x}</strong> signify the following:
<ul>
   <li>
      <strong>{1}</strong>: Context of the application. The context is used for application-dependent
      configuration files (see <int:link pageid="134" />).
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>{2}</strong>: Language of the application. The language is used for language-dependent
      elements (see <int:link pageid="046" anchor="Chapter-2-2-Getstring" />).
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>{3}</strong>: Namespace of the base template. In order to load an initial template you
      need to provide a namespace or path respectively.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>{4}</strong>: Name of the base templates. The parameter takes the name of the template
      file without it's extension.
   </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="Chapter-3-2-Templates"><a href="#Chapter-3-2-Templates">3.2. Construction of the templates</a></h4>
<p>
   Templates ara playing a big role within the adventure php framework. Abstractly spoken, each node of
   a web page or application forms a "small MVC section" that consists of a model (commonly the model of
   the application or website), the view (an XML / HTML template) and a controller (named document
   controller) if applicable. The kernel of the framework contains the page controller component that
   generates a DOM tree out of the templates specified in either the <strong>index.php</strong> or by
   any includes in templates. The page controller executes specified controller during transformation
   of the DOM tree.
</p>
<p>
   The semantics of the templates thereby defines the complexity of the desired page and thus directly
   influences the structure of the DOM tree generated by the page controller. By calling the
   <strong>loadDesign()</strong> method in the <strong>index.php</strong> the initial template of an
   application or web page is loaded. This file defines the basic structure of the page. Each template
   included forms a child node of the initial DOM node - the Document. The depth of the tree is not
   limited to any number. The initial demo page template mentioned before can be seen in the following
   code box:
</p>
<gen:highlight type="html">
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Demo&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=iso-8859-1" /&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
...
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</gen:highlight>
<p>
   Further examples on templates can be read about in the chapters <int:link pageid="014"/> and
   <int:link pageid="047"/>. The <int:link pageid="048"/> gives you a closer look at create web pages
   and applications.
</p>

<h4 id="Chapter-3-3-Basic-configuration"><a href="#Chapter-3-3-Basic-configuration">3.3. Basic configuration</a></h4>
<p>
   In contrast to earlier versions of the framework (&lt; 1.7), you do not need any further basic
   configuration. The core components' configuration parameter are stored in the <strong>apf::core</strong>
   namespace of the <int:link pageid="067" />. In order to manipulate them to fit your special needs,
   the desired parameters must be changed in the central bootstrap file as described below. The registry
   is not only an information pool for the framework's core, but can also be used to store information
   about concrete applications.
</p>
<gen:highlight type="php">
// include the page controller (APF core library)
include_once('./apps/core/pagecontroller/pagecontroller.php');

// include the front controller
import('core::frontcontroller', 'Frontcontroller');

// change the environment parameter used by the ConfigurationManager
Registry::register('apf::core','Environment','MY_ENV');

// change the base path to your application
Registry::register('apf::core','URLBasePath','http://mybaseurl.de');

// change the url rewriting mode (true: URL params are separated by a "/", false: "normal" URLs)
Registry::register('apf::core','URLRewriting',true);

// change log directory
Registry::register('apf::core','LogDir','/path/to/my/log/dir');

// create and configure front controller
$fC = &Singleton::getInstance('Frontcontroller');
$fC->setContext('{1}');
// optional: $fC->setLanguage('{2}');

// start request processing and send result to the client
echo $fC->start('{3}', '{4}');
</gen:highlight>
<p>
   The registry parameters have the following meaning:
</p>

<h5 id="Chapter-3-3-1"><a href="#Chapter-3-3-1-Environment">3.3.1. Environment</a></h5>
<p>
   <strong>Used by:</strong> ConfigurationManager, MySQLxHandler, MySQLHandler, SQLiteHandler, ...
</p>   
<p>
   Every configuration file exists of four different components:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Namespace: The folder below which all configuration files of this application lie</li>
   <li>Context: Current context of the application</li>
   <li>Environment: e.g. for development, test and live</li>
   <li>File name: Name of the configuration file</li>
</ul>
<p>
   This abstraction was introduced, so that an application or a module can be integrated into
   different other applications or modules and is executable on different systems at the same time
   without change of the source code. Nevertheless, for the loading of configurations there are
   standardised methods, so that the programmer must not look after it any more. Continuing material
   can be found under <int:link pageid="134" />.   
</p>
<p>
   <strong>Default value:</strong> &quot;DEFAULT&quot;
</p>

<h5 id="Chapter-3-3-2-URLBasePath"><a href="#Chapter-3-3-2-URLBasePath">3.3.2. URLBasePath</a></h5>
<p>
   <strong>Used by:</strong> AdvancedBBCodeParser, SocialBookmarkManager, ...
</p>
<p>
   Many modules link on itself or different areas of a module or a web page. That's why it must be
   confessed how the base URL of the site is. The registry value URLBasePath defines this.
</p>
<p>
   <strong>Default value:</strong> &quot;HTTP_HOST value of the $_SERVER array&quot;
</p>

<h5 id="Chapter-3-3-3-URLRewriting"><a href="#Chapter-3-3-3-URLRewriting">3.3.3. URLRewriting</a></h5>
<p>
   <strong>Used by:</strong> ChainedGenericInputFilter, ChainedGenericOutputFilter, LinkGenerator, ...
</p>
<p>
   The <int:link pageid="137" />s and the <int:link pageid="138">LinkGenerator</int:link> shipped
   with the APF support url rewriting. This means that you can use urls like 
   <em>http://www.domain.tld/param1/value1/param2/value2</em> instead of
   <em>http://www.domain.tld?param1=value1&amp;param2=value2</em>. If this value is set to
   &quot;true&quot; the <int:link pageid="138">LinkGenerator</int:link> outputs rewritten links.
</p>
<p>
   Details can be taken from the <int:link pageid="069" /> or <int:link pageid="137" /> or
   <int:link pageid="138" /> chapter.
</p>
<p>
   <strong>Default value:</strong> &quot;false&quot;
</p>

<h5 id="Chapter-3-3-4-LogDir"><a href="#Chapter-3-3-4-LogDir">3.3.4. LogDir</a></h5>
<p>
   <strong>Used by:</strong> Logger, ...
</p>
<p>
   To allow a central Logging mechanism, the path in which the log files should be written must be
   defined centrally. The path is used by the class <strong>Logger</strong>.
</p>
<p>
   <strong>Default value:</strong> &quot;./logs&quot;
</p>

<h5 id="Chapter-3-3-5-LibPath"><a href="#Chapter-3-3-5-LibPath">3.3.5. LibPath</a></h5>
<p>
   <strong>Used by:</strong> various extensions, ...
</p>
<p>
   The <strong>LibPath</strong> directive stores the basic path to the framework's code files. The
   directory path is set dynamically and the value is read only.
