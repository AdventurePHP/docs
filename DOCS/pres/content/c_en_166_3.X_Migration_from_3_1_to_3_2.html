   This page describes the adaptions of your current software (up to and including release 3.1) necessary to upgrade it
   to release 3.2.
</doku:title>
<h3 id="Chapter-1-Introduction"><a href="#Chapter-1-Introduction">1. Introduction</a></h3>
<p>
   Version 3.2 is almost fully compatible with it's predecessor. After execution of the automatic migration only minor
   adaptions are necessary as described in <a href="#Chapter-3-Manual-steps">chapter 3</a>.
</p>
<div class="hint">
   As of the 3.2 release enhancement of version version 3.1 will be discontinued. Security and bug fixes will be available
   until mid of 2017.
</div>
<p>
   This article shows how to update your application to APF version 3.2. As you might already be familiar with from previous
   versions migration can be done in an automated fashion for nearly all changes. For this reason, the release contains
   two scripts: <em>migrate-code.sh</em> to update your HTML and PHP files and <em>migrate-config.sh</em> for configuration
   files.
</p>
<div class="hint">
   The APF team recommends to use the migration scripts rather than upgrading manually. This not only saves time and
   money but also ensure that all relevant areas of your project code are covered.
</div>
<p>
   The below chapters contain an in-depth description on how to switch to APF 3.2 and which kind of changes have to be
   applied to your existing application(s) to run them based on this version.
</p>

<h3 id="Chapter-2-Automated-migration"><a href="#Chapter-2-Automated-migration">2. Automated migration</a></h3>
<p>
   Migration can be done using the migration script shipped along with the release. This release includes changes to
   code, templates, and configuration files. Using <em>migrate-code.sh</em> and <em>migrate-config.sh</em> you can
   easily be adapted your existing application to the new scheme.
</p>
<div class="warn">
   Please be sure to execute all steps described under <int:link pageid="165" />. In case you are using an order version
   of the APF, please <em>completely</em> migrate to version 3.1. Instructions can be taken from <int:link pageid="100" />.
</div>
<div class="err">
   Please create a backup before execution of the scripts to be able to restore parts of your application if necessary!
</div>
<p>
   In case your development environment is windows, please install the latest <em>cygwin</em> version (download under
   <a class="external" href="http://cygwin.com/install.html">cygwin.com</a>). Migration for Windows Batch Scripts is
   not supported.
</p>
<p>
   To update the code files to the latest scheme, please execute the script as follows:
</p>
<div class="warn">
   Please change to the code directory before execution to avoid unexpected results.

<h3 id="Chapter-3-Manual-steps"><a href="#Chapter-3-Manual-steps">3. Manual steps</a></h3>
<p>
   Unfortunately, not all components of your application can be migrated by the delivered scripts. This chapter lists
   all changes to be applied by hand.
</p>

<h4 id="Chapter-3-1-API-change-place-holder"><a href="#Chapter-3-1-API-change-place-holder">3.1. API change place holder</a></h4>
<p>
   In version 3.2 methods <em>setPlaceHolderIfExist()</em> and <em>setPlaceHoldersIfExist()</em> have veen removed from
   classes <em>Document</em> and <em>BaseDocumentController</em> due to <em>Issues #284</em>. This improved performance
   for setting place holders significantly.
</p>
<p>
   During automated migration both methods will be removed from your project code automatically. Please ensure that
   both methods are removed from code that overwrites APF functionality.
</p>
<p>
   Please use <em>setPlaceHolder()</em> and <em>setPlaceHolders()</em> instead. Both methods will no longer throw an
   <em>InvalidArgumentException</em> as of release 3.2 in case a place holder has not been found.
</p>

<h4 id="Chapter-3-2-BenchmarkTimer-report"><a href="#Chapter-3-2-BenchmarkTimer-report">3.2. BenchmarkTimer report</a></h4>
<p>
   With <em>issues #214</em> performance of the <em>BenchmarkTimer</em> has been significantly improved. To ensure
   better extensibility the measuring and report generation functionality have been separated. Measuring events is now
   delivered by <em>DefaultStopWatch</em> and <em>HtmlReport</em> takes responsiblity for report generation.
</p>
<p>
   To ease analysis of the HTML reports even before version 3.2 critical times are marked red. To adapt the default
   threshold for critical times you can use method <em>setCriticalTime()</em>:
</p>
<gen:highlight type="php">
$t = Singleton::getInstance(BenchmarkTimer::class);
$t->setCriticalTime(0.15);
echo $t->createReport();
</gen:highlight>
<p>
   Since report generation is now part of a separate component - <em>HtmlReport</em> - definition of critical times
   must be done with this new component. For this reason, please adapt all above code snippets as described in the
   subsequent code box:
</p>
<gen:highlight type="php">
$t = Singleton::getInstance(BenchmarkTimer::class);
$report = new HtmlReport();
$report->setCriticalTime(0.15);
echo $t->createReport($report);
</gen:highlight>
