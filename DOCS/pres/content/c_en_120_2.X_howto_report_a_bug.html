   This page describes, how you should report a bug to enable the developer team to understand your
   need and to be able to react as fast as you'd expect them to do.

<h3>Where to report a bug</h3>
<p>
   The Adventure PHP Framework uses as central Issue Management Tool (Tracker) that contains all bugs and features. Defects
   should thus be reported to the <a class="tracker" href="http://tracker.adventure-php-framework.org/" title="APF Bug-Tracker" linkrewrite="false">Tracker</a>
   directly. In case you do not have an account, please sign up first. Afterwards, you can
   <a class="tracker" href="http://tracker.adventure-php-framework.org/bug_report_page.php" title="APF Bug-Tracker: Create entry" linkrewrite="false">create a new entry</a>.
</p>

<h3>Search the existing bug reports first!</h3>
<p>
   Read the documentation carefully and always search the bug database first. This avoids duplicate
   bug reports and helps us to save time spent on analyzing duplicate reports.
</p>

<h3>Try the current SVN version</h3>
<p>
   If applicable, please try to use a current version from the SVN. Probably, the bug has already been
   fixed. For detailed instructions on how to obtain a copy from the svn, please refer to
   <int:link pageid="068" />.

<h3>The basics: what you did, what you wanted to happen, and what actually happened.</h3>
<p>
   Those three elements are the basics for all bug reports. It is important to tell us, what you have
   tried to do (e.g. include taglib within a template) and what actually happened (e.g. taglib was not
   executed). The better the description, the faster the problem could be analyzed and a bug fix could
   be created.
</p>

<h3>What must be included in a bug report</h3>
<p>
   A good bug report contains the following parts:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>A summary of the actual problem to give information about the context of your work.</li>
   <li>A couple of sentences describing, what you did, what you wanted to happen, and what actually happened.</li>
   <li>A code sample enabling a developer to reproduce the bug.</li>
</ul>
<p>
   In case, these things are present, we are sure to be able to provide a quick bug fix - in case it is a true bug. ;)
