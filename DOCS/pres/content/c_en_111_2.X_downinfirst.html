<h3 id="Chapter-1-Introduction"><a href="#Chapter-1-Introduction">1. Introduction</a></h3>
<p>
   This is a step-by-step tutorial, which shows you how to set up and use the Adventure PHP Framework (short: APF).
</p>

<h3 id="Chapter-2-Requirements"><a href="#Chapter-2-Requirements">2. Requirements</a></h3>
<p>
   First, you need a PHP-capable server. As local test server under windows you might have a look at
   <a class="external" href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html" title="XAMPP for windows">XAMPP page</a>. It
   contains an installation of all important server components like Apache, PHP, MySQL, etc. Depending
   on your setup, you need to adjust the paths used in this tutorial. On LINUX/UNIX boxes you might
   install the PHP libraries using your favorite package manager.
</p>

<h3 id="Chapter-3-Download"><a href="#Chapter-3-Download">3. Download</a></h3>
<p>
   Under <int:link pageid="008"/> you can always find the latest version. Writing this tutorial, version 2.0 was the
   latest.
</p>
<p>
   There, the following packages are available:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>
      <strong> Example project: (apf-demopack-*):</strong>
      Contains all necessary APF files and some examples. It's designed for beginners.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Framework code release: (apf-codepack-*):</strong>
      This contains all necessary APF files. It is designed for daily use.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Sample configuration package: (apf-configpack-*):</strong>
      This contains some sample configurations, which are useful while creating the own configurations.
   </li>
</ul>
<p>
   For this tutorial we will use the "framework code release", which you can download now.
</p>

<h3 id="Chapter-4-Installation"><a href="#Chapter-4-Installation">4. Installation</a></h3>
<p>
   You need to understand the structure of the folders first. This tutorial expects the document root
   (the folder which is being opened when you visit <em>http://localhost/</em> in your browser) under
   <em>/xampp/htdocs</em>.
</p>
<p>
   The APF is designed delivering a website using only one file. This file (e.g. <em>index.php</em>) is
   called "bootstrap" file. We create the folder <em>/xampp/htdocs</em> for it.
   Here you can further place public accessible files (e.g. CSS, JS, pictures).
</p>
<p>
   For security reasons the APF files should not be accessible for the public, otherwise the public might read
   your configuration files. The best way would be, placing the package above the document root. If that's
   not possible (e.g. on a simple web space without control of the document root) please proceed with
   <a href="#Chapter-4-2-Installation-under-document-root">chapter 4.2</a> where
   a special security rule is being created. Otherwise follow the description in
   <a href="#Chapter-4-1-Installation-above-document-root">chapter 4.1</a>.
</p>

<h4 id="Chapter-4-1-Installation-above-document-root"><a href="#Chapter-4-1-Installation-above-document-root">4.1. Installation above the document root</a></h4>
<p>
   Because the document root is placed at <em>/xampp/htdocs</em>, we will create <em>/xampp/APF/</em> where the files
   downloaded before should be extracted.
</p>
<p>
    You should now have the following directory structure:
</p>
<gen:highlight type="code">
/xampp/APF/
           core/
           modules/
           tools/
           ...
       htdocs/
</gen:highlight>
<p>
   You can now proceed with <a href="#Chapter-5-First-steps">chapter 5</a>.
</p>

<h4 id="Chapter-4-2-Installation-under-document-root"><a href="#Chapter-4-2-Installation-under-document-root">4.2. Installation under document root</a></h4>
<p>
   If you intend to install the APF within an area that is accessible from the public you need to ensure that the files
   are protected adequately.
</p>
<p>
   Please create <em>/xampp/htdocs/APF/</em> and extract the downloaded package in here.
</p>
<p>
   You should now have the following directory structure:
</p>
<gen:highlight type="code">
/xampp/htdocs/APF/
                  core/
                  modules/
                  tools/
                  ...
</gen:highlight>
<p>
   In order to secure the APF files please create a <strong>.htaccess</strong> file within  <em>/xampp/htdocs/APF</em>
   with the following content:
</p>
<gen:highlight type="shell">
# Apache <=2.2
Order allow,deny
deny from all

# Apache >=2.4
Require all denied
</gen:highlight>
<div class="hint">
   When uploading the <em>.htaccess</em> file via FTP you need to make sure that ASCII-mode is enabled,
   otherwise there could be problems.
</div>

<h3 id="Chapter-5-First-steps"><a href="#Chapter-5-First-steps">5. First steps</a></h3>
<div class="hint">
   Since we used different installation folders in chapter <a href="#Chapter-4-1-Installation-above-document-root">4.1</a>
   and <a href="#Chapter-4-2-Installation-under-document-root">4.2</a> folder <em>/APF</em> both refers to <em>/xampp/APF</em>
   with an installation outside of the document root as well as to <em>/xampp/htdocs/APF</em> which means installing the
   APF within the document root.
</div>
<p>
   Let's explain the folders first:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>
      <strong>/APF/core/</strong>: Contains all important APF base libs.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>/APF/modules</strong>: Contains some optional modules which are provided together
      with the APF. If you want to use them, you need to configure them first. How this works can be
      read in the tutorials on the
      <int:link pageid="119" anchor="Modules">overview page of built-in modules</int:link>.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>/APF/tools</strong>: Contains some little but useful tools.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>/APF/extensions</strong>: This folder contains extensions to the APF.
   </li>
</ul>
<p>
   Please now create the <strong>/xampp/htdocs/index.php</strong> file. We will now write a simple &quot;hello world!&quot;
   application in order to explain the base functions of the APF.
</p>
<div class="hint">
   Hereafter the term <em>namespace</em> will be used instead of <em>folder</em>. The reason for
   this is: the namespace is a relative addressing from the <strong>/APF</strong>
   folder. In the namespace all &quot;/&quot; must be replaced with &quot;\&quot;.
</div>
<p>
   We now need to create the folder <em>/APF/helloworld</em> that contains the template - <em>helloworld.html</em>. The
   template should be added the following content:
</p>
<gen:highlight type="code">Hello World!</gen:highlight>
<p>
   In order to generate the output please adapt the previously created <em>index.php</em> as follows
</p>
<gen:highlight type="php">
// Include bootstrap file for the folder configured in chapter 4.1
include('../APF/core/bootstrap.php');

   // Include bootstrap file for the folder configured in chapter 4.2
include('./APF/core/bootstrap.php');

use APF\core\singleton\Singleton;
use APF\core\frontcontroller\Frontcontroller;

// create the front controller
$fC = &Singleton::getInstance('APF\core\frontcontroller\Frontcontroller');

// start request processing and send result to the client
echo $fC->start('APF\helloworld', 'helloworld');
</gen:highlight>
<p>
   First of all, the <em>bootstrap.php</em> is included that executes the basis configuration of the framework. After
   that, the front controller is created and started with the initial template. The first parameter of the <em>start()</em>
   method is the namespace (=path to the template) and the second names the template file. Template files are always
   passed without their file extension within the APF since the <em>*.html</em> extension is appended by convention
   automatically. Last but not least, the content is sent to the client via <em>echo</em>.
</p>
<p>
   The exact function of the front controller can be read about on the <int:link pageid="012"/> page.
</p>
<p>
   In order to see the result please call
</p>
<gen:highlight type="code">http://localhost/index.php</gen:highlight>
<p>
   within your browser. There you should see <em>Hello World!</em> now.
</p>

<h3 id="Chapter-6-Summary"><a href="#Chapter-6-Summary">6. Summary</a></h3>
<p>
   Now the base functionality of the APF should be clear. In order to get to know the many other
   functions, you should read some more tutorials. We suggest the <int:link pageid="048" /> tutorial as a next step.

   <p class="author"><strong>About the author:</strong></p>
   <p>
      <strong>Ralf Schubert</strong>, an enthusiastic APF developer likes the framework giving the chance
      to easily develop reusable gui elements (aka. widgets). This is one of the reasons, why he had
      chosen the APF to be his application development framework of choice.
   </p>
   <p>
      To support beginners, he wrote this article to give a brief introduction into the framework and to
      ease the first steps using the APF.
