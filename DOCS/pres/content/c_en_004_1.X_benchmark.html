  The present chapter describes, how the APF helps you to develop fast internet applications. The
  benchmark component of the framework thus already benchmarks every important component at
  development state.
</doku:title>
Performance is am extremely important topic on web applications. No visitor is likely to wait longer
than 10 seconds to see a web page. For this reason a benchmark component was introduced to this
framework. With the <strong>BenchmarkTimer</strong> component is is easy to controll the performance
of an application or just a single module during development. The component measures all relevant
parts by setting mesuring points within application parts and contains methods to display the process
tree of the applications performance values. The page and front controller implementations already
have included a lot of important measuring points to guarantee accurate performance tracking
out-of-the-box. In example, the performance of each document controller is recorded by default.

Benchmarking applications or parts of an application is quite easy. To measure a particural part of
the code, the follwoing code must be introduced to the program:
<gen:highlight type="php">
// start timer
$t = &Singleton::getInstance('BenchmarkTimer');
$t->start('MyEvent');

//
// code to be benchmark'ed
//

// stop timer
$t->stop('MyEvent');
</gen:highlight>
Please note, that the <em>BenchmarkTimer</em> must <strong>always</strong> be instanciated singleton
style, because all timing information have to be stored in a single instance of the
<em>BenchmarkTimer</em> to generate a proper process tree. If this is fact is not kept in mind,
benchmark information might be lost. Further, the scope of applications must be considered. This means,
that breakpoints throughout functions or classes determine, that the instance of the
<strong>BenchmarkTimer</strong> must be fetched by using the <em>Singleton</em> class every time
<strong>start()</strong> or <strong>stop()</strong> is called. In such situations, the following code
can be used:
<gen:highlight type="php">
// start timer
$t = &Singleton::getInstance('BenchmarkTimer');
$t->start('MyEvent');

//
// code to be benachmarked
//

// stop timer
$t = &Singleton::getInstance('BenchmarkTimer');
$t->stop('MyEvent');
</gen:highlight>
In most situations, this case is not necessary.

<h3 id="Chapter-2-Benchmark-reports"><a href="#Chapter-2-Benchmark-reports">2. Benchmark reports</a></h3>
Due to the fact, that the present framework is written to operate in the so called <strong>post-back
mode</strong>, the developer is able to easily integrate benchmark reporting in the central bootstrap
file (mostly <em>index.php</em>). In the majority of cases it is adequate to place
<gen:highlight type="php">
$t = &Singleton::getInstance('BenchmarkTimer');
echo $t->createReport();
</gen:highlight>
at the end of the <em>index.php</em> file. If it is desired to not display benchmark information in
the live system you might place the following code at the bottom of the <em>index.php</em> file:
<gen:highlight type="php">
if(isset($_REQUEST['benchmarkreport']) && $_REQUEST['benchmarkreport'] == 'true'){
   $t = &Singleton::getInstance('BenchmarkTimer');
   echo $t->createReport();
}
</gen:highlight>
This makes it possible to display benchmark information on demand by adding the parameter
<strong>benchmarkreport=true</strong> to the current URL. In case of URL rewriting, the parameter must
be rewrited to <strong>/benchmarkreport/true</strong> or <strong>/~/benchmarkreport/true</strong> for
use in frontcontroller applications. If this parameter is present the following report will be displayed
at the end of the HTML page:

<p>
   As of release 1.11 it is possible to deactivate the benchmarker. This can be used to reduce the
   time needed for request processing. Experimental tests proof, the request processing can be
   boosted on 25% with the benchmarker being deactivated. Because the benchmarker fulfils no necessary
   function in production environments, switching off the tool is not combined with any disadvantages.
</p>
<p>
   Switching off the benchmarker can be done using the subsequent code snippet:
</p>
<gen:highlight type="php">
$bench = &Singleton::getInstance('BenchmarkTimer');
$bench->disable();
</gen:highlight>
<div class="hint">
   In order to guarantee efficient disabling, the above presented lines of code should be directly
   placed after the inclusion of the page controller.
