   This chapter describes the architecture and the function of the input and output filter concept
   that is available since release 1.14.
</doku:title>
<h3 id="Chapter-1-Introduction"><a href="#Chapter-1-Introduction">1. Introduction</a></h3>
<p>
   One main concept of the Adventure PHP Framework is the separation between url or url layout
   respectively and the functionality of the software in common. You can find many framework
   products that have a strong binding between the url and software components that leads to adaption
   of the software components in case the url changes. Further, direct adressing leads to less
   granularity concerning your software components or modules. This makes reusability a hard job to
   do.
</p>
<p>
   A further aspect is the HMVC implementation of the APF (see <int:link pageid="098" />) that
   enables you to build up your application or website out of any number of parts that are also
   runnable in standalone mode. Directly adressing the MVC document controllers (see
   <int:link pageid="006" />) used within your application would be much overhead on the one hand
   and significently decreases readability and massively disturbes SEO optimization efforts.
</p>
<p>
   For this reason, the APF uses decouples software components from the url based on the input and
   output filters. <em>Input filters</em> are designed to transform the incoming request to a generic,
   internal representation that is understood by any software component. After application execution
   <em>Output filters</em> then transform the internal representation into the outside form to
   let the user not know about the internals.
</p>
<p>
   Beside the classic application case <em>URL-Layout</em> there are further possibilities to
   use input and output filters. One example is shrinking of HTML code, injection of content after
   the transformation phase, and securing user input.
</p>

<h3 id="Chapter-2-Architecture"><a href="#Chapter-2-Architecture">2. Architecture</a></h3>
<p>
   The following sequence diagram presents the timing model of the input and output filters:
</p>
<img src="http://media.adventure-php-framework.org/content/filter_timing_model.png" alt="Filter timing modell" />
<p>
   Input and output filters are executed within a filter chain according to the order they are added.
   Within the <em>FilterChain</em> each filter can decide whether the next filter is executed and
   which input the next filter gets. All shipped default filters do not interrupt the chain.
</p>
<p>
   The chains for input and output filtering are singleton objects (valid within one request) and
   can be accessed from all APF components. Normally, configuration is done within the bootstrap file
   (<em>index.php</em>).
</p>
<p>
   The <int:link pageid="012" anchor="Chapter-1-Introduction">timing model of the front controller</int:link>
   describes that the <em>FilterChain</em> including the input filters us executed by the front
   controller at the beginning of the request processing. This ensures, that all information sent
   with the request has been transformed to an internal representation before the front controller
   starts to handle the request.
</p>
<p>
   Moreover, the timing model describes that after front controller execution the generated HTML
   output is passed to the <em>FilterChain</em> including the output filters. This ensures that the
   content can be adapted to the outside representation.
</p>

<h4 id="Chapter-2-1-FilterChain"><a href="#Chapter-2-1-FilterChain">2.1. FilterChain</a></h4>
<p>
   Due to configuration reasons and to express the two different intents of the <em>FilterChain</em>
   for input as well as for output filters, two separate implementations are shipped with the APF:
   the <em>InputFilterChain</em> and <em>OutputFilterChain</em>.
</p>
<p>
   Both classes are derived from the generic <em>AbstractFilterChain</em> that implements the
   <em>FilterChain</em> interface:
</p>
<gen:highlight type="php">
interface FilterChain {
   public function filter($input);
   public function appendFilter(ChainedContentFilter $filter);
   public function prependFilter(ChainedContentFilter $filter);
   public function removeFilter($class);
}

abstract class AbstractFilterChain implements FilterChain {

   ...

   public function filter($input) {
      ...
   }

   public function &appendFilter(ChainedContentFilter $filter) {
      ...
   }

   public function &prependFilter(ChainedContentFilter $filter) {
      ...
   }

   public function &removeFilter($class) {
      ...
   }

   public function &reset() {
      ...
   }

   public function &clear() {
      ...
   }

}
</gen:highlight>

<h4 id="Chapter-2-2-Filter"><a href="#Chapter-2-2-Filter">2.2. Filter</a></h4>
<p>
   As you might have taken from the code stub of the previous chapter the filter chains are able to
   process filters that comply with the <em>ChainedContentFilter</em> interface. In contrast to the
   filter implementation before 1.14 the are passed the content to filter as well as the
   <em>FilterChain</em> for further proceeding:
</p>
<gen:highlight type="php">
interface ChainedContentFilter {
   function filter(FilterChain &$chain, $input = null);
}   
</gen:highlight>
<p>
   Thus, each input and output filter is able to proceed with the chain or to interrupt it returning
   the filtered content. Beyond, each filter can inject or remove filters from the chain as desired.
</p>
<p>
   One potential application case of adding filters within the chain is configuring filters
   according to the result of a previous one. For example, a &quot;RouterFilter&quot; may add a
   special filter concerning the desired url layout (e.g. <em>/shop</em> ->
   <em>ShopUrlLayoutInputFilter</em>, <em>/page</em> -> <em>PagesUrlLayoutInputFilter</em>).
</p>
<div class="warn">
   Please note, that filters that have already been executed within the chain cannot be removed during
   execution of the <em>FilterChain</em>. Otherwise, the chain would become inconsistent.
</div>
<p>
   The implementation of a filter can be derived from any base class (e.g. the functionality from
   <em>APFObject</em>) but must be compliant with the interface above.
</p>
<p>
   The next code block contains a filter implementation that removes all unnecessary spaces and
   line breaks from the HTML code:
</p>
<gen:highlight type="php">
use APF\core\filter\ChainedContentFilter;

class WhitespaceOutputFilter implements ChainedContentFilter {

   public function filter(FilterChain &$chain, $input = null) {

      // remove newline and blank characters
      $input = preg_replace('/\r|\n|\t|\s{3,}/', '',$input);

      // execute further filters on the chain
      return $chain->filter($input);
   }

}
</gen:highlight>
<div class="hint">
   <p>
      You can add filters before and during execution of the <em>FilterChain</em>. For this purpose you can use
      <em>appendFilter()</em> to add a filter at the end of the chain and  <em>prependFilter()</em> to add a filter
      to the start.
   </p>
   <p>
      Please note that filters prepended to the chain during execution may not be executed.
   </p>

</div>

<h3 id="Chapter-3-Configuration"><a href="#Chapter-3-Configuration">3. Configuration</a></h3>
<h4 id="Chapter-3-1-Default-setup"><a href="#Chapter-3-1-Default-setup">3.1. Default setup</a></h4>
<p>
   Installing the APF from a fresh release package, the filer chains are already pre-configured with
   the default filter by the front controller. These are the <em>ChainedUrlRewritingInputFilter</em> as
   an input filter to resolve the url layout described in chapter 4 and the
   <em>ChainedUrlRewritingOutputFilter</em> as an output filter to rewrite urls to their external
   representation in cass url rewriting is activated.
</p>

<h4 id="Chapter-3-2-Adapted-setup"><a href="#Chapter-3-2-Adapted-setup">3.2. Adapted setup</a></h4>
<p>
   As already mentioned above, the configuration of the chains is normally done within the bootstrap
   file (<em>index.php</em>) but can be adapted within all software components <em>on-demand</em>.
</p>
<p>
   Setting up the <em>FilterChain</em> is easy to do after including the page controller and front
   controller:
</p>
<gen:highlight type="php">
include('./APF/core/bootstrap.php');

use APF\core\filter\InputFilterChain;
use APF\core\filter\OutputFilterChain;

// add an additional custom input filter
use VENDOR\project\filters\AdditionalInputFilter;
InputFilterChain::getInstance()->appendFilter(new AdditionalInputFilter());

// add an additional custom output filter
use VENDOR\project\filters\AdditionalOutputFilter;
OutputFilterChain::getInstance()->appendFilter(new AdditionalOutputFilter());

// clear chain and add a custom input filter
use VENDOR\project\filters\CustomInputFilter;
InputFilterChain::getInstance()->clear()->appendFilter(new CustomInputFilter());

// clear chain and add a custom output filter
use VENDOR\project\filters\CustomOutputFilter;
OutputFilterChain::getInstance()->clear()->appendFilter(new CustomOutputFilter());
</gen:highlight>
<p>
   Due to the fact, that the chain is able to execute any number of filters each combination of
   the above samples can be used to create your project setup. In order to configure more custom
   input filters and one more custom output filter the following code is sufficient:
</p>
<gen:highlight type="php">
include('./APF/core/bootstrap.php');

use APF\core\filter\InputFilterChain;
use APF\core\filter\OutputFilterChain;

// cleas chain and add custom input filters
use VENDOR\project\filters\AdditionalInputFilterOne;
use VENDOR\project\filters\AdditionalInputFilterTwo;
InputFilterChain::getInstance()
   ->clear()
   ->appendFilter(new AdditionalInputFilterOne())
   ->appendFilter(new AdditionalInputFilterTwo());

// add another output filter
use VENDOR\project\filters\AdditionalOutputFilter;
OutputFilterChain::getInstance()->appendFilter(new AdditionalOutputFilter());
</gen:highlight>
<p>
   If you intend to change the order within the chain, please clear and re-setup the chain.
</p>

<h4 id="Chapter-3-3-Interrupting-the-chain"><a href="#Chapter-3-3-Interrupting-the-chain">3.3. Interrupting the chain</a></h4>
<p>
   As noted in the previous chapter the execution of the chain can be influenced by each filter. In
   case a filter implementation directly returns the output, the filter chain execution is
   interrupted. This means that filters that are registered to be invoked after this particular
   filter will not be executed:
</p>
<gen:highlight type="php">
use APF\core\filter\ChainedContentFilter;

class IgnorantOutputFilter implements ChainedContentFilter {

   public function filter(FilterChain &$chain, $input = null) {
      return $input;
   }

}
</gen:highlight>

<h4 id="Chapter-3-4-Deactivating-filters"><a href="#Chapter-3-4-Deactivating-filters">3.4. Deactivating filters</a></h4>
<p>
   In order to deactivate the default filters completely, just add the following to your bootstrap
   file:
</p>
<gen:highlight type="php">
include('./APF/core/bootstrap.php');

use APF\core\filter\InputFilterChain;
use APF\core\filter\OutputFilterChain;

InputFilterChain::getInstance()->clear();
OutputFilterChain::getInstance()->clear();
</gen:highlight>

<h4 id="Chapter-3-5-Removing-filters"><a href="#Chapter-3-5-Removing-filters">3.5. Removing filters</a></h4>
<p>
   The implementation of the APF filter chain provides the facility to remove single filters by their
   <em>class name</em>:
</p>
<gen:highlight type="php">
include('./APF/core/bootstrap.php');

use APF\core\filter\OutputFilterChain;

// remove an output filter
OutputFilterChain::getInstance()->removeFilter('ChainedUrlRewritingOutputFilter');
</gen:highlight>

<h3 id="Chapter-4-Url-layout"><a href="#Chapter-4-Url-layout">4. Url layout</a></h3>
<p>
   The classic approach of input and output filters within the APF is resolving different url layouts
   and processing the information (e.g. <int:link pageid="012">front controller actions</int:link>).
   Custom filters can be added during chain execution or replaced by other filters to control the
   input and output.
</p>
<p>
   The url layout of the APF handles two cases: normal urls and so-called <em>rewrite urls</em> that
   are url paths that represent normal urls. Within the next chapters these two alternatives are
   discussed in detail:
</p>

<h4 id="Chapter-4-1-Normal-urls"><a href="#Chapter-4-1-Normal-urls">4.1. Normal urls</a></h4>
<p>
   <em>Normal</em> urls are urls that address one or more bootstrap files and contain dynamic
   parameters. Example:
</p>
<gen:highlight type="code">
http://www.example.com/index.php?page=news&amp;news-page=2
</gen:highlight>
<p>
   The request parameters are already interpreted by the web server and passed to the PHP engine. Thus,
   no processing is needed for this case.
</p>
<p>
   Nevertheless, normal urls can contain front controller action instructions that are encoded in
   a special way:
</p>
<gen:highlight type="code">
http://www.example.com/index.php?APF_modules_captcha_biz-action:showCaptcha=name:0123456789|mode:transparent
</gen:highlight>
<p>
   The above url addresses an action within the namespace <em>APF\modules\captcha\biz</em> having the
   name <em>showCaptcha</em>. The action is passed the parameters <em>name</em> and <em>mode</em>.
   An action definition like this can be present several times within the url and can have any number
   of parameters. In addition, &quot;normal&quot; parameters can be mixed with front controller
   action instructions as desired.
</p>
<p>
   The scheme of action url representations can be read about in the
   <int:link pageid="012" anchor="Chapter-3-2-2-Dynamic-actions">URL-Layout</int:link> chapter of the
   front controller documentation.
</p>
<p>
   In case of normal urls the duty of the input filter is to analyze the front controller instruction
   (namespace, action name, parameter) and to add the action to the front controller's action stack.
</p>

<h4 id="Chapter-4-2-Rewrite-urls"><a href="#Chapter-4-2-Rewrite-urls">4.2. Rewrite urls</a></h4>
<p>
   The difference between rewrite urls and normal urls is the separation of the parameters. Couples
   of parameters are not separated by &quot;<em>&amp;</em>&quot; but by &quot;<em>/</em>&quot; and
   parameter names from their values by &quot;<em>/</em>&quot;, too. In order to resolve this scheme
   a separator must be defined to distinguish between normal parameters and action instructions.
   Further, a separator between different action instructions must be defined to be able to add any
   number of action instructions to the url.
</p>
<p>
   For this reason, the &quot;/~/&quot; separator has been introduced. This sign separates normal
   parameter strings from front controller actions that are treated differently. Simple
   parameter-value-couples are resolved to associative assignments and are added to the
   <em>$_REQUEST</em> array. Actions are resolved according to their
   <int:link pageid="012" anchor="Chapter-3-2-2-Dynamic-actions">url layout</int:link> and passed to
   the front controller as described for &quot;normal&quot; urls.
</p>
<p>
   The following code box presents the rewritten url for the first sample within the last chapter
   (simple parameters only):
</p>
<gen:highlight type="code">
http://www.example.com/page/news/news-page/2
</gen:highlight>
<p>
   Having a look at the front controller action sample, the rewritten url is like this:
</p>
<gen:highlight type="code">
http://www.example.com/~/APF_modules_captcha_biz-action/showCaptcha/name/0123456789/mode/transparent
</gen:highlight>
<p>
   The necessary adaption to operate an application in rewrite url mode can be taken from the
   <int:link pageid="069" /> page.
</p>
<div class="hint">
   Further notes on implementing custom url layouts can be found in the wiki article
   <a class="wiki" href="http://wiki.adventure-php-framework.org/Implementierung_von_eigenen_URL-Layouts">Implementierung von eigenen URL-Layouts</a>
   (German).
</div>

<h4 id="Chapter-4-3-Output-formatting"><a href="#Chapter-4-3-Output-formatting">4.3. Output formatting</a></h4>
<p>
   A further part of the filters delivered with the APF is the output filter. This component is
   responsible to rewrite &quot;normal&quot; urls to slash-urls. The filter is executed after the
   page is transformed and all front controller actions are executed to adapt the generated content.
</p>
<p>
   To support the output filter's tasks or to avoid url re-formatting you may implement and configure
   your own <int:link pageid="138">link scheme</int:link>. Doing so, the urls will be formatted
   correctly during transformation time.
