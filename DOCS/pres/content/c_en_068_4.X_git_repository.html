   All sources of the Adventure PHP Framework are managed within a public GitHub repository. You can get the current
   development state as well as bug fixes from there. Further, you may want to have a look at new features that have not
   been integrated to the main stream.
</doku:title>
<p>
   In Release 2.1 source code management has been changed to <a class="external" href="http://git-scm.com">GIT</a> and
   the repository has moved to <a class="external" href="https://www.github.com/AdventurePHP">GitHub</a>.
</p>
<p>
   The GitHub repositories contain all components of the frameworks, the documentation, sample applications (i.e.
   the <int:link pageid="074" />), and further tools.
</p>
<div class="hint">
   Please note that sources from the <em>master</em> or <em>feature-*</em> branches may contain unstable changes. Thus,
   please use <em>release-*</em> branches to your convenience. If you want to try out new functionality, you are welcome
   to use the current development state.
</div>
<p>
   The <em>code</em> repository contains the core of the framework. In case you want to use it on your local environment,
   just do the following:
</p>
<gen:highlight type="shell">
mkdir APF && cd APF
git clone https://www.github.com/AdventurePHP/code .
</gen:highlight>
<p>
   Now, you can run your applications as you are used to for normal APF releases.
</p>

   More on working with GIT and the APF can be read about in our Wiki under
   <a class="wiki" href="${getBaseUrl(WikiBaseURL)}/GIT_Repository/en">GIT Repository</a> and
   <a class="wiki" href="${getBaseUrl(WikiBaseURL)}/Lokales_Setup_APF-Doku-Seite/en">Local setup of the APF docs page</a>.

<div class="hint">
   In case a release has not been published yet, snapshots are created once per hour from the <em>code</em> repository.
   At present, the following snapshots are available:
   <ul>
      <li><a class="external" href="${getBaseUrl(FilesBaseURL)}/snapshot/apf-4.1-snapshot-php7.tar.gz" linkrewrite="false">4.1</a></li>
   </ul>
