   <h3><a href="#">APF page goes offline!</a></h3>
   <div class="date">Wednesday, 27. January 2021</div>
   <p>
      In the <em>last two years</em> I shifted my focus to new challenges in my professional and private life. For this
      reason, the last official APF release is already &quot;getting old&quot;.
   </p>
   <p>
      Overall, I only had little time to bring the APF further and this won't change in foreseeable time. That said, I
      herewith quit my work on the APF - tears (this has been a tough decision!) and joy (it was an amazing time!)
      involved.
   </p>
   <div>
      <h4>What does that mean?</h4>
      <ul>
         <li>The official APF page will be offline by <strong>end of February</strong>.</li>
         <li>
            The GitHub organisation and the project <strong>will be still available</strong> incl. code.
         </li>
         <li>
            The <strong>Wiki</strong> has already been switched off and the articles have been published in the
            <a class="external" linkrewrite="false" href="https://github.com/AdventurePHP/wiki-export">wiki-export repository</a>
            as <em>.md</em> files.
         </li>
         <li>
            The <strong>Forum</strong> is also offline by now and communication can be handled using the
            <a class="external" linkrewrite="false" href="https://github.com/orgs/AdventurePHP/projects/1">GitHub Issue Tracking</a>.
         </li>
         <li>
            The issues of the former <strong>bug tracker</strong> have been imported as GitHub issues and are available
            <a class="external" linkrewrite="false" href="https://github.com/AdventurePHP/code/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed">here</a>.
         </li>
         <li>
            Die <strong>Dokumentation</strong> ist in Form von (Roh-)HTML-Dateien weiter unter
            <a class="external" linkrewrite="false" href="https://github.com/AdventurePHP/docs/tree/master/DOCS/pres/content">AdventurePHP/docs</a>
            verfügbar.
         </li>
      </ul>
   </div>
   <p>
      I wanted to say <strong>thank you</strong> for all your support and partnership on the APF over the last many
      years. It was a <strong>great time</strong> and an <strong>amazing experience</strong> for me!
   </p>
   <p>
      In case you are interested in helping with further development, don't hesitate to contact me via GitHub, e-mail,

   <h3><a href="#">APF 4.0 released!</a></h3>
   <div class="date">Sunday, 27. January 2019</div>
   <p>
      The APF Team is proud to release version <em>4.0</em> of the Adventure PHP Frameworks.
   </p>
   <p>
      With <em>release 4.0</em> the APF requires at least <strong>PHP 7.0.0</strong>. Switching to PHP 7, many native
      language features have been introduces - i.e. typed method arguments - and the code base has been optimized
      completely.
   </p>
   <p>
      <strong>Here is an overview of the most important changes:</strong>
   </p>
   <ul>
      <li>At least PHP 7.0 required!</li>
      <li>Method signatures are strongly typed!</li>
      <li>mcrypt replaced with OpenSSL.</li>
      <li>GORM now supports <em>beforeDelete()</em> hook for domain objects.</li>
      <li>GORM now supports table prefixes.</li>
      <li><em>&lt;form:listener /&gt;</em> tags can now be used in <em>&lt;form:error /&gt;</em> tags.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>
      Using version 4.0 requires changes to your existing code base due to changes of the APF API. Please find instructions
      and hints under <int:link pageid="171"/>. The complete API can be found under
      <a href="/files/4.0/docs/html/index.html" class="external">API documentation</a>.
