      The APF team today released version 2.1 of the Adventure PHP Frameworks. IT's the section version of the <em>2.X</em>
      series and brings a couple of new features and improvements of the previous release.
   </p>
   <p>
      The best feature for us is certainly the implementation of the extended templating syntax offering a short hand
      notation for place holders. This saves typing and integrates better with the IDE. Further, a notation for
      accessing objects from a DOM node has been added. Details cen be found under <int:link pageid="047" />.
   </p>
   <p>
      The front controller and the <em>LinkScheme</em> implementations delivered have been improved to be able to
      define shorter and more user friendly URLs. Long namespaces and action names are history. Details can be found
      under <int:link pageid="012" />.
   </p>
   <p>
      Besides the two <em>big</em> changes this new version includes further enhancements of <em>performance</em>,
      <em>error handling</em>, and <em>security</em>. A detailed summary can be found under

   <div class="date">Saturday, 20th October 2013</div>
   <p>
      Along with the technical changes for APF 2.0 the documentation has been updated and enhanced for a large number of
      the chapters! We are convinced that getting familiar with the Adventure PHP Framework becomes much easier now.
   </p>
   <p>
      Here are the chapters with the biggest changes or new sections:
   </p>
   <ul>
      <li><int:link pageid="013" /></li>
      <li><int:link pageid="014" /></li>

      <li><int:link pageid="147" /></li>
   </ul>
   <p>
      Due to the fact that <em>APF 2.0-beta</em> is a preview version <em>APF 1.17-stable</em> is still supported. Thus,
      documentation is available for both versions. By default, the newest version is selected but you can easily switch
      to the <em>Version 1.X</em> line at any time.
   </p>
   <p>
      In order to improve documentation feedback is highly appreciated at any time! Please report your experience using

   <h3><int:link pageid="008">Version 1.17 (stable) released!</int:link></h3>
   <div class="date">Saturday, 17th of November 2012</div>
   <p>
      The APF team is proud to announce the stable release of version 1.17. It understands itself as a maintenance
      release but however includes several new features.
   </p>
   <p>
      This version contains all features described on the
      <a class="wiki" href="http://wiki.adventure-php-framework.org/Roadmap#Version_1.17" title="Roadmap">roadmap</a>.
   </p>
   <p>
      The major feature changes are:
   </p>
   <ul>
      <li>
         Within this release the largest clean-up of tag class and method names in the history of the APF was conducted.
         This includes removal of old conventions for tag class names as well as of names of private and protected
         methods and variables. A full list of changes and migration hints can be taken from <int:link pageid="153" />.
      </li>
      <li>
         The APF parser is now able to resolve nested structures of tags with the same prefix and name within one
         document or a file. This eases the implementation of tags compared to the previous version once again.
         Details on this feature can be taken from the tutorial
         <int:link pageid="147" anchor="Chapter-6-3-Nested-structures"/>.
      </li>
      <li>
         This new release includes full support for PHP's <a class="external" href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.apc.php">APC</a>
         extension with the <em>ApcCacheProvider</em> (see <int:link pageid="084" anchor="Chapter-3-7-APC-cache-provider" />)
         and the <em>ApcConfigurationProvider</em> (see <int:link pageid="134" anchor="Chapter-3-5-APC-provider" />).
         Both can be used to store application data within an APC in-memory store which can accelerate applications by
         factor 4-5.
      </li>
      <li>
         With the present release the <int:link pageid="023" /> has been redesigned from the scratch. Besides the
         consolidation with the <int:link pageid="081" /> adding more flexibility and increase the extensibility has
         been the focus of 1.17's work.
      </li>
      <li>
         The state model of APF form controls has been added a visibility indicator. You are now able to hide form
         fields and their dependent controls programmatically. Details can be taken from the
         <int:link pageid="114" anchor="Chapter-8-Visibility-of-form-controls" /> chapter.
      </li>
      <li>
         Besides the new functionality this APF release contains several bug fixes and optimizations to code and
         documentation.

   <div class="date">Saturday, 17th of November 2012</div>
   <p>
      The APF team is proud to announce the stable release of version 1.16.
   </p>
   <p>
      This version contains all features described on the
      <a class="wiki" href="http://wiki.adventure-php-framework.org/Roadmap#Version_1.16" title="Roadmap">roadmap</a>.
   </p>
   <p>
      The major feature changes are:
   </p>
   <ul>
      <li>
         The biggest change in release 1.16 was done behind the scenes affecting one of the key components of the APF:
         the tag parser. With the new style of tag definition naming and reusability of tag implementations have been
         improved considerably. XML prefix and name can be now defined freely and tags can be used within any level of
         hierarchy. Further, the performance has been increased by 10-10%.
      </li>
      <li>
         The APF form support now includes a multi-file-upload by <em>Werner Liemberger</em>. The feature is based on
         jQuery and integrates into APF forms seamlessly.
      </li>
      <li>
         APF user <em>Coach83</em> contributed the implementation of the roadmap feature permanent log-in for the user
         management module. Users that have logged-in once stay logged-in even after closing the browser.
      </li>
      <li>
         Release 1.16 now supports a native integration of ReCaptcha - the CAPTCHA service by Google. Similar to the
         existing implementation - of course the existing implementation is still supported - ReCaptcha can be
         integrated via tag.
      </li>
      <li>
         <em>Nicolas Pecher</em> finished the work of <em>Werner Liemberger</em> creating a new set of file system
         tools. The APF now contains a brand new abstraction for accessing folders and files.
      </li>
      <li>
         Besides the new functionality this APF release contains several bug fixes and optimizations to code and
         documentation.
      </li>
   </ul>

         application without code changes. Further, the module now saves password data in a more secure way using static
         and user-dependent dynamic salts.
      </li>
      <li>
         The famous o/r mapper of the APF has been added domain object handling. This feature supports the implementation
         according to the <em>domain object</em> software design pattern. Moreover, the update tool and the query facade
         <em>GenericCriterionObject</em> have been enhanced.

   <div class="date">Sunday, 31st of Januar 2010</div>
   <p>
      The APF team is proud to announce the new website together with the 1.11 stable release.
   </p>
   <p>
      Revision 1.11 comes up with a revised version of the <int:link pageid="113">form support</int:link>
      on the basis of taglibs. Now generic definition of validators and filters on the basis of the 
      observer pattern is supported and forms can be easier adjusted to own needs.
   </p>
   <p>
      The OR mapper <int:link pageid="063">GenericORMapper</int:link>, already added in the release
      1.9, was extended with tools to <int:link pageid="063" anchor="Chapter-3-Database-setup">automatically setup</int:link>
      and <int:link pageid="128">update a database</int:link>. Now the developer can completely
      concentrate on the development of the logic of the application since the storage of the
      objects is completely managed by the mapper.
   </p>
   <p>
      Part of the release's performance optimization were optimizations in the core of the
      frameworks and the rework of the integrated <int:link pageid="004">BenchmarkTimer</int:link>.
      It now supplies the developer with a better graphical representation of the measurements to
      find hot spots within an application. Thus an application can be optimally prepared for operation.
   </p>
   <p>
      With release of version 1.11 the support for PHP 4 has been announced for discontinuation and the
      compatibility with PHP 5.3 has been improved. The coming version 1.12 will focus on the extension
      of the new form support and the rework of the configuration component.

   <p>
      The APF team is proud to announce the stable release of the 1.10 series. Within this
      maintenance release, development entirely switched to PHP5. A compatibility version for PHP4 will
      be available since the beginning of 2010. Beneath some clean-ups and refactorings , several
      performance optimization tasks guarantee excellent performance. The probably biggest technical
      innovation is the introduction of the "dependency injection container" similar to the objection
      initialization of SPRING (JAVA). Further, this release contains many features, that were discussed
      in the developer forum to be included.
