  The page controller provides a generic environment to implement applications using the MVC pattern.
  This includes mechanisms to load and manage templates using taglibs, executing controllers and
  manage the DOM tree created by the controller.

<p>
   The page controller is the heart of the Adventure PHP Framework. The functionality of the page controller
   is to provide a reusable environment for applications, that are implemented following the <strong>MVC</strong>
   pattern. It features a unique mechanism to load and handle <int:link pageid="047">templates</int:link> with aid of
   the functionality contained in <int:link pageid="147">tags</int:link>, to execute
   <int:link pageid="006">controllers</int:link> and to manage the MVC tree, that was build by the taglib functionality.
</p>
<p>
   Because of the DOM tree structure, the page controller is a HMVC controller. This pattern describes,
   that a hierarchical DOM tree consists of any count of MVC cells, that are managed by a generic
   component (here: the APF page controller). Applying the HMVC pattern, you assume, that a model is
   not bound to one MVC cell strictly, but is available for more than one DOM nodes. This makes it
   possible to easily and flexibly develop modules and applications.

<h3 id="Chapter-2-Functionality"><a href="#Chapter-2-Functionality">2. Functionality</a></h3>
<p>
   Due to the fact, that the page controller does only provide a framework, or is responsible to operate
   it's workflow respectively, the application logic can directly be influenced by
   <int:link pageid="147">tags</int:link> and <int:link pageid="006">controllers</int:link>.
   This means, that the page controller is application logic independent. For this reason it is
   possible to create tags with different functions (e.g. forms, include further templates,
   place holders, ...). The workflow diagram describes the actions, that are passed through, and the
   points, the developer can influence to apply the requirements of his application to. Click on the

<p>
   The following list describes the workflow again in textual form:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    At the beginning of a request the
    <int:link pageid="013" anchor="Chapter-5-1-Creating-the-bootstrap-file">bootstrap file</int:link> (typically:
    <em>index.php</em>) is called.
  </li>
  <li>
    As of the <em>loadDesign()</em>, the initial <int:link pageid="047">template</int:link> is
    loaded and parsed.
  </li>
  <li>
    During the parse operation, the page controller looks up, if the <int:link pageid="047">template</int:link>
    contains <int:link pageid="006">document controller</int:link> declarations and further tags as
    described on <int:link pageid="046" />.
  </li>
  <li>
    If a <int:link pageid="006">document controller</int:link> tag is included,
    this information is extracted from the content and prepared for the transformation.
  </li>
  <li>
    If known tags as described on <int:link pageid="046" /> are included, they are analyzed and
    linked as child objects into the current DOM node.
  </li>
  <li>
    During the parse operation of the current tag, the corresponding tag lib class (PHP class) is
    created and the attributes and the content is applied to that instance. After that, the
    <em>onParseTime()</em> method is called (see <int:link pageid="147" />).
    The implementation of this function affects the proceeding of the content of the tag, that can
    possibly contain further tags. Thus, the content is typically processed for known tags and so on...
  </li>
  <li>
    After parsing a node, it is linked to the DOM tree as a child of the current node. Then, the
    <em>onAfterAppend()</em> method is called on each of the children. As of this moment,
    the single nodes "know" their neighbours through the <em>$this->parentObject</em> and
    <em>$this->children</em> references. Hence, the <em>onAfterAppend()</em> contains
    tag functionality, that needs to know it's related DOM nodes.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the <em>loadDesign()</em> method has finished, a complete APF DOM tree is available,
    that consists of a number of nodes, that are directly influenced by the template and tag definition
    the developer created.
  </li>
  <li>
    On the <em>$page->transform()</em> call, the DOM tree is traversed recursively and each element
    is transformed. Thereby, each node is responsible for it's transformation itself. Because most
    of the nodes typically extend the <em>Document</em> class, tha workflow is as follows:
    at first, the method checks, if a document controller was defined. If yes, the class is created
    and applied with the references, attributes and contents necessary for transformation. After that
    the <em>transformContent()</em> is called.
  </li>
  <li>
    After the <int:link pageid="006">document controller</int:link> execution the list of child
    nodes of the current DOM node is walked through and transformed by calling the <em>transform()</em>
    method on each of the children. Each node is responsible for it's transformation itself. The
    only thing, that is important is, that the function call must return the transformed content of
    the node, because the calling node has to continue processing it.
  </li>
</ul>
