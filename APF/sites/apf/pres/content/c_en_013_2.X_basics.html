<h3 id="Chapter-1-Introduction"><a href="#Chapter-1-Introduction">1. Introduction</a></h3>
<p>
   The Adventure PHP Framework (briefly: <em>APF</em>) is designed to assist the developer with the implementation of
   object oriented and reusable PHP based web applications. It makes use of and implements several important object
   oriented design patterns and offers a large set of solutions for day-2-day tasks.
</p>
<p>
   The APF is <em>no</em> complete and ready-to-use application that only needs to be configured prior to run but a
   strong basis to create such application easily and using common software development procedures.
</p>

<h3 id="Chapter-2-Principles-and-Paradigms"><a href="#Chapter-2-Principles-and-Paradigms">2. Principles and Paradigms</a></h3>
<p>
   As other PHP frameworks the APF follows dedicated principles and paradigms. The following list contains a list of
   the most important ones:
</p>
<ol>
   <li>
      <strong>Framework instead of class library</strong>:
      The APF understands itself as a framework not a class library. It clearly follows it's paradigms and offers
      development workflows and patterns that are fully interwoven with the framework. This fact - sometimes misleadingly
      referred to as restriction - prevents new developers from mistakes and enables you to create applications with
      proven patterns.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Object orientation</strong>:
      The components of the Adventure PHP Framework are all designed with object orientation in mind. This enables you
      to create functionality according to their concern that are easily reusable and thus offer a solution for your
      day-2-day work.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Design pattern</strong>:
      The components of the APF are all designed along with known software design pattern to ease getting started and
      to use consistent wording.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Bootstrapping</strong>:
      In order to ease configuration and implementation the APF uses a single entry point for all applications - the
      so-called bootstrap file. This file (e.g. <em>index.php</em>) answers all requests as desired by the developer.
      Details can be taken from <int:link pageid="014" /> or <int:link pageid="111" />.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Separation of code and configuration</strong>:
      Separation of application logic and configuration allows you to create reusable components and modules. In case
      you leverage the APF capabilities you can easily create multiple projects based on the same code base or to run
      a multi-project hosting environment based on one APF installation. Details can be taken from <int:link pageid="134" />.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Open to enhancement</strong>:
      The APF follows the <em>open close principle</em>. You are provided dedicated extension points but you cannot
      completely change the framework. Although the provided <em>extension points</em> let you realize even exotic
      requirements by enhancing the framework's capabilities according to your project.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Open source</strong>:
      The Adventure PHP Framework is an Open Source product! In case you would like to contribute, we'd love to welcome
      you within our <int:link pageid="149" />. In other cases, please <int:link pageid="034" /> us or create a thread
      within our <a class="forum" href="http://forum.adventure-php-framework/">Forum</a>. We are looking forward to
      get in touch from you!

<h3 id="Chapter-3-The-APF-101"><a href="#Chapter-3-The-APF-101">3. The APF 101</a></h3>
<p>
   The following chapters contain basic topics on the APF.
</p>

<h4 id="Chapter-3-1-What-do-I-need-to-get-started"><a href="#Chapter-3-1-What-do-I-need-to-get-started">3.1. What do I need to get started?</a></h4>
<p>
   The Adventure PHP Framework is a framework written for <a class="external" href="http://www.php.net">PHP</a> to
   develop web applications. For this reason you need a web server including the PHP module. You may want to use the
   de-facto standard <a class="external" href="http://httpd.apache.org">Apache HTTP Server</a> or
   <a class="external" href="http://nginx.org/en/docs/">nginx</a> respectively.
</p>
<p>
   The APF 2.X requires PHP &gt; 5.3.0 since it is based on PHP namespaces. APF 1.X also works with Version less than
   5.3.0. Well-known packages such as <a class="external" href="http://www.apachefriends.org/de/xampp.html">XAMPP</a>
   already contain the required PHP version.
</p>
<p>
   In order to quick-start with the framework it is recommended to download a <em>apf-demopack-*</em> file. These files
   do not only contain the APF code but a ready-to-use example web site -  the <int:link pageid="074" />. The Sandbox
   contains a large number of examples and wizards to get familiar with the APF. In case you don't have experience with
   the APF yet, the Sandbox can also be used as a development environment for custom modules or components. Later on,
   they can be easily integrated into your own web site.
</p>
<p>
   To gain efficiency while programming the APF team strongly recommends to use
   <a class="external" href="http://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/">PHPStorm</a>. It contains code completion, direct
   feedback on coding issues and a decent integration of <a class="external" href="http://xdebug.org/docs/remote">xdebug</a>
   to analyze errors within your application.
</p>
<p>
   Now it's up to you! With the above tools you are now well-equipped to start with development!
</p>

<h4 id="Chapter-3-2-Where-do-I-find-important-resources"><a href="#Chapter-3-2-Where-do-I-find-important-resources">3.2. Where do I find important resources?</a></h4>
<p>
   The pages of the Adventure PHP Frameworks are separated into two main areas: the <int:link pageid="008" /> area and
   the <int:link pageid="072" />.
</p>
<p>
   Under <int:link pageid="008" /> you can find the downloads of the current release and a reference on experimental versions
   (see <int:link pageid="068" />). If you are looking for current snapshots, please refer to <int:link pageid="068" />.
</p>
<p>
   The documentation of the framework is located under <int:link pageid="072" />. There are the following areas: the
   <int:link pageid="119" /> with a separate chapter on each component, the <int:link pageid="071" /> and the
   <int:link pageid="100" /> section with further information on the framework and software development in common.
</p>
<p>
   Besides, you are provided the <a class="forum" href="http://forum.adventure-php-framework.org">Forum</a> and the
   <a class="wiki" href="http://wiki.adventure-php-framework.org/Hauptseite">Wiki</a>.
</p>

<h4 id="Chapter-3-3-Which-components-does-the-APF-have"><a href="#Chapter-3-3-Which-components-does-the-APF-have">3.3. Which components does the APF have?</a></h4>
<p>
   The Adventure PHP Framework has four main areas: the <em>core</em> that contains basic components, the <em>tools</em>
   area that ships components that ease development and the <em>modules</em> and <em>extensions</em> section that include
   ready-to-use modules or extensions.
</p>
<p>
   Each release includes several packages that are all based on the <em>apf-codepack-*</em> files that contains the code
   base of the APF. Besides, the <em>apf-configpack-*</em> listed under <int:link pageid="008" /> contains a set of
   sample content files according to each version.
</p>
<p>
   In case you are searching for implementation samples, you may want to use the <int:link pageid="074" /> (package:
   <em>apf-demopack-*</em>) or the sample packages <em>apf-calc-example-*</em> (simple calculator), <em>apf-modules-example-*</em>
   (inclusion of dynamic modules), or <em>apf-vbc-example-*</em> - a sample implementation for <int:link pageid="086" />.
</p>

<h3 id="Chapter-4-Folder-structure"><a href="#Chapter-4-Folder-structure">4. Folder structure</a></h3>
<p>
   As noted in <a href="#Chapter-3-1-What-do-I-need-to-get-started">chapter 3</a> the <em>apf-codepack-*</em> files
   contain the code base of the Adventure PHP Framework. The package contains the following folders:
</p>
<gen:highlight type="code">
APF/
    core/
    extensions/
    modules/
    tools/
</gen:highlight>
<p>
   The <em>core</em> and <em>tools</em> folders contain the core parts of the framework. Within <em>core</em>
   you can find the implementation of the <int:link pageid="098" /> (<em>/APF/core/pagecontroller/</em>) and the
   <int:link pageid="012" /> (<em>/APF/core/frontcontroller/</em>), having a look at <em>tools</em> you may find the
   <int:link pageid="113" /> implementation (<em>/APF/tools/form/</em>).
</p>
<p>
   <em>modules</em> contains modules that are based on <em>core</em> and <em>tools</em> components. These are i.e. the
   <int:link pageid="089" /> and the <int:link pageid="095" /> that can be added to your custom web page easily.
</p>
<p>
   Details on the components can also be taken from the <int:link pageid="002" />.
</p>

<h3 id="Chapter-5-A-simple-application"><a href="#Chapter-5-A-simple-application">5. A simple application</a></h3>
<p>
   This chapter shows you how to create a very simple page using the <em>apf-codepack-*</em> release file.
</p>
<div class="hint">
   Further content to get started with the APF and how to construct web sites can be found under
   <int:link pageid="014" />, <int:link pageid="111" />, or <int:link pageid="048" />. More tutorials are listed under
   <int:link pageid="071" />.
</div>

<h4 id="Chapter-5-1-Creating-the-bootstrap-file"><a href="#Chapter-5-1-Creating-the-bootstrap-file">5.1. Creating the bootstrap file</a></h4>
<p>
   As described in <a href="#Chapter-2-Principles-and-Paradigms">chapter 2</a> the APF uses the <em>boot-strapping</em>
   concept. This means that the requests of all visitors are handled by one central file (<em>index.php</em> in most
   cases, bacause this file is configured as <em>DirectoryIndex</em>).
</p>
<p>
   In order to create a simple application please download a <em>apf-codepack-*</em> release file and extract it into
   a folder located under the <em>DOCUMENT_ROOT</em> of your web server. After that, please create an <em>index.php</em>
   file in parallel to the <em>APF</em> folder.
</p>
<p>
   Every web page or web application starts with an initial template that takes includes all areas of your application.
   Please use the following code as a basis for this chapter for the <em>index.php</em> file:
</p>
<gen:highlight type="php">
include('./APF/core/bootstrap.php');

use APF\core\singleton\Singleton;
use APF\core\frontcontroller\Frontcontroller;
$fC = &Singleton::getInstance('APF\core\frontcontroller\Frontcontroller');

echo $fC->start('APF\site\templates', 'main');
</gen:highlight>
<p>
   Within the first line the <em>APF/core/bootstrap.php</em> is included. This file includes all necessary APF components
   and does the initial configuration.
</p>
<p>
   Line 5 creates an instance of the <int:link pageid="012" /> and within the last line the request processing is started
   by applying the initial template. The <em>echo</em> causes the return value - the content of the entire page - to be
   sent back to the user.
</p>
<div class="hint">
   Further instructions on how to configure your application within the <em>index.php</em> file can be found under
   <int:link pageid="134" />, <int:link pageid="137" />, <int:link pageid="069" />, and <int:link pageid="023" />.
</div>

<h4 id="Chapter-5-2-Basic-template"><a href="#Chapter-5-2-Basic-template">5.2. Basic template</a></h4>
<p>
   Templates play a central role within the Adventure PHP Framework. As mentioned in the last chapter each application
   starts from a basic template and the <int:link pageid="098" /> uses templates for it's template-centric implementation
   of the <em>HMVC</em> pattern.
</p>
<p>
   Within the above sample the <int:link pageid="012" /> is started with the basic template <em>main</em> from the
   <em>APF\site\templates</em> namespace. Hence, it expects the <em>main.html</em> file to be stored within folder
   <em>APF/site/templates</em>. The folder structure is thus as follows:
</p>
<gen:highlight type="code">
APF/
    core/
    extensions/
    modules/
    site/
         templates/
                   main.html
    tools/
</gen:highlight>
<p>
   In case you add
</p>
<gen:highlight type="html">
My first application with the APF!
</gen:highlight>
<p>
   to the template file and call the <em>index.php</em> you will be presented the text of the template.
</p>
<p>
   This sample assumes that the standard configuration of the APF has not been changed - especially concerning the
   <em>ClassLoader</em> configuration. Details on the configuration can be taken from chapter <int:link pageid="154" />.
</p>
<div class="hint">
   Further examples on templates can be read about in chapters <int:link pageid="014"/> and <int:link pageid="047"/>.
   The <int:link pageid="048"/> tutorial provides an introduction on how to create web pages and applications.
</div>

<h3 id="Chapter-6-Basic-configuration"><a href="#Chapter-6-Basic-configuration">6. Basic configuration</a></h3>
<p>
   For parameters that are used by various components the framework provides a configuration facility making use of the
   <int:link pageid="067" />. In case you intend to adapt those parameters please use the <em>index.php</em>.
</p>
<p>
   The following list shows all relevant parameters from the <em>APF\core</em> namespace:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>
      <strong>Environment</strong>:
      The <em>Environment</em> property allows you to distinguish configuration properties between different physical
      environments your software is operated in (e.g. test or production environment). Details can be taken from chapter
      <int:link pageid="134" anchor="Chapter-2-1-Konfigurations-Schema" />.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>InternalLogTarget</strong>:
      Defines the name of the standard log target for framework error messages. Details on usage and configuration are
      described in chapter <int:link pageid="023" anchor="Chapter-3-1-Verwalten-von-LogWritern" />.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>Charset</strong>:
      Defines the character set that is used for string operations such as <em>htmlspecialchars()</em>. The default
      value (<em>UTF-8</em>) is initialized within the <em>boostrap.php</em> file.
   </li>
</ul>
<p>
   In case you want to change one or more of the parameters please added the following code to your <em>index.php</em>:
</p>
<gen:highlight type="php">
include('./APF/core/bootstrap.php');

use APF\core\registry\Registry;

Registry::register('APF\core', 'Environment', 'TEST');
Registry::register('APF\core', 'InternalLogTarget', 'framework');
Registry::register('APF\core', 'Charset', 'UTF-16');
