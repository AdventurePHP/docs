   The Adventure PHP Framework implements three special styles of the singleton pattern:
   an abstract singleton class, a session singleton class and an application singleton mechanism to manage instances
   within your application.
</doku:title>
<p>
   The singleton pattern is one of the well-known software design patterns. It belongs to the group of creation patterns
   and is often used to provide data or functionality of dedicated objects within a well-defined area of validity.
</p>
<p>
   The APF implements three styles of the pattern for different areas of validity:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>
      <strong>Singleton</strong>: This implementation allows to create objects that are unique within one request. Within
      subsequent requests the instances loose their validity and are thus created again.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>SessionSingleton</strong>: This class allows you to create objects that are unique within one session.
      In case the session ends objects created within this context will loos their validity and thus will be created
      again.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>ApplicationSingleton</strong>: In case you intend to use components throughout several requests and sessions
      you may want to use this implementation. The status of the instance is maintained as long as the web server is
      running.
   </li>
</ul>
<div class="hint">
   Please note that the areas of validity are only reached in case you retrieve the object instances with the classes
   listed above in any case or using the <int:link pageid="107" anchor="Chapter-3-ServiceManager">ServiceManager</int:link>
   or the <int:link pageid="107" anchor="Chapter-4-DIServiceManager">DIServiceManager</int:link>.
</div>
<div class="warn">
   Using the <em>ApplicationSingleton</em> implementation requires PHP extension <em>APC</em>.
</div>
<div class="warn">
   Please be aware to deal with PHP's serialization features using <em>SessionSingleton</em> and <em>ApplicationSingleton</em>.
   This means that resources (e.g. file pointers, database connections) cannot be serialized and thus need to be re-created
   within subsequent requests.
</div>
<p>
   The areas of validity listed above can be used to design applications that contain shared elements (e.g. business
   services, database connections or connections to external systems) that can be configured and used within various
   components. This does not only lead to better performance but also allows encapsulation of configuration and
   initialization of certain application parts.
</p>
<p>
   The Adventure PHP Framework implements the <em>abstract singleton pattern</em> and provides different implementations.
   In contrast to the <em>simple singleton pattern</em> you can create various classes using the available styles but
   in parallel ensure testability.
</p>
<p>
   The following chapters describe the implementation flavours in depth and contain examples and hints on using them.
</p>

<h3 id="Chapter-1-Singleton"><a href="#Chapter-1-Singleton">1. Singleton</a></h3>
<p>
   In order to create a unique instance of a class valid within one HTTP request you may want to use the
   following code:
</p>
<gen:highlight type="php">
use APF\core\singleton\Singleton;
use VENDOR\..\FooModel;

$model = Singleton::getInstance('VENDOR\..\FooModel');
</gen:highlight>
<p>
   In case the instance has not yet been created within the current request it is created for you in the background and
   returned for further usage. In case the instance has already been created you will receive this instance.
</p>
<p>
   The <em>getInstance()</em> allows to apply an instance identification besides the class to create. This parameter can
   be used in case more than one instance is used within one application in parallel. You can use this facility in case
   of multiple database connections based on the same connection implementation.
</p>
<p>
   Usage is as follows:
</p>
<gen:highlight type="php">
use APF\core\singleton\Singleton;
use APF\core\database\MySQLiHandler;

$connectionOne = Singleton::getInstance('APF\core\database\MySQLiHandler', 'ConnOne');

$connectionTwo = Singleton::getInstance('APF\core\database\MySQLiHandler', 'ConnTwo');
</gen:highlight>
<p>
   Both variables <em>$connectionOne</em> and <em>$connectionTwo</em> now contain an instance of the
   <em>APF\core\database\MySQLiHandler</em> class but with different instance configuration (e.g. different database).
</p>
<div class="warn">
   Please note, that each instance (e.g. <em>ConnOne</em>) must be obtained invoking the second parameter calling
   <em>getInstance()</em>. Otherwise, a new instance will be created.
</div>

<h3 id="Chapter-2-SessionSingleton"><a href="#Chapter-2-SessionSingleton">2. SessionSingleton</a></h3>
<p>
   In order to create a unique instance of a class valid within one HTTP session and across multiple HTTP requests you
   may want to create data containers as <em>SessionSingleton</em> instance. To create an instance of a workflow model
   that is intended to store data from a multi-page workflow you can use the following code:
</p>
<gen:highlight type="php">
use APF\core\singleton\SessionSingleton;
use VENDOR\..\FooModel;

$model = SessionSingleton::getInstance('VENDOR\..\FooModel');
</gen:highlight>
<p>
   In case the the model instance has not been created within the current session it will be created lazily and returned
   back to the code it is used in. If the object has been requested before you will be returned the previously created
   instance. This can be used to collect and store user data within a multi-page workflow to be processed at the
   end of the flow.
</p>
<p>
   The <em>getInstance()</em> allows to apply an instance identification besides the class to create. This parameter can
   be used in case more than one instance is used within one application in parallel. You can use this facility to allow
   multiple workflows using the same code base within one application.
</p>
<p>
   Usage is as follows:
</p>
<gen:highlight type="php">
use APF\core\singleton\Singleton;
use VENDOR\..\FooModel;

$modelOne = SessionSingleton::getInstance('VENDOR\..\FooModel', 'WorkflowOne');

$modelTwo = SessionSingleton::getInstance('VENDOR\..\FooModel', 'WorkflowTwo');
</gen:highlight>

<h3 id="Chapter-3-ApplicationSingleton"><a href="#Chapter-3-ApplicationSingleton">3. ApplicationSingleton</a></h3>
<p>
   To use information for all visitors and only one time within your application - independent from request and
   session - you may want to create data containers as <em>ApplicationSingleton</em> instance. This creation method
   is especially interesting in case object initialization is time-consuming but it can be used across all users and
   hence across all requests. (e.g. connection to external weather forecast service).
</p>
<p>
   In order to create a service that can be used allover your application please use the following code:
</p>
<gen:highlight type="php">
use APF\core\singleton\ApplicationSingleton;
use VENDOR\..\WeatherService;

$service = ApplicationSingleton::getInstance('VENDOR\..\WeatherService');
</gen:highlight>
<p>
   In case the the model instance has not been created within the current session it will be created lazily and returned
   back to the code it is used in. If the object has been requested before you will be returned the previously created
   instance.
</p>
<p>
   The <em>getInstance()</em> allows to apply an instance identification besides the class to create. This parameter can
   be used in case more than one instance is used within one application in parallel. You can use this facility to allow
   multiple connections to different weather forecast service using the same service implementation.
</p>
<p>
   Usage is as follows:
</p>
<gen:highlight type="php">
use APF\core\singleton\ApplicationSingleton;
use VENDOR\..\WeatherService;

$serviceOne = ApplicationSingleton::getInstance('VENDOR\..\WeatherService', 'ServiceOne');

$serviceTwo = ApplicationSingleton::getInstance('VENDOR\..\WeatherService', 'ServiceTwo');
</gen:highlight>

<h3 id="Chapter-4-Further-reading"><a href="#Chapter-4-Further-reading">4. Further reading</a></h3>
<p>
   Based on the creation methods described in <a href="#Chapter-1-Singleton">chapter 1</a> (<em>Singleton</em>),
   <a href="#Chapter-2-SessionSingleton">chapter  2</a> (<em>SessionSingleton</em>) und
   <a href="#Chapter-3-ApplicationSingleton">chapter  3</a> (<em>ApplicationSingleton</em>) the APF offers further tools
   to create, configure and maintain object instances.
</p>
<p>
   The <int:link pageid="107" anchor="Chapter-3-ServiceManager">ServiceManager</int:link> offers an abstraction of the
   above-listed methods and helps to configure the created objects.
</p>
<p>
   The <int:link pageid="107" anchor="Chapter-4-DIServiceManager">DIServiceManager</int:link> is an <em>dependency
   injection container</em> that helps to separate code and configuration as well as to decouple components within your
   application to ensure exchangeability and testability.
</p>
<div class="hint">
   Creating complex applications it is recommended to to use the <em>DIServiceManager</em> to create instances since the
   above-listed mechanisms do not provide configuration facilities.
