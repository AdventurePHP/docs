  This tutorial depicts how existing functionality can easily be enhanced and made capable for the
  current use case.

<h3 id="Chapter-1-Introduction"><a href="#Chapter-1-Introduction">1. Introduction</a></h3>
<p>
   I'm sure, every developer was once faced with the situation, that an existing library helped to solve
   most of the previous tasks, but is not able to handle the current special case. Many developers then
   tend to implement a completely new function to meet the current case's needs. Others try to convulsively
   find another library that handles this case. All of these possibilities help you to get the goal, but
   reduce the maintainability of your software and increase error rate due to a "wild" combination of
   various external libraries and special functions for several special cases. Furthermore, each developer
   should keep in mind, that API changes originate changes to every function that uses the libray and
   is this equal to leaving the update path of the external library. Perhaps, even quick hacks won't
   work in the next version of the third party library.
</p>
<p>
   This tutorial wants to explain a method to enhance existing functionality without changing the
   provided library. The tutorial assumes, that the used library is third party code. Otherwise, this
   method doesn't make sense.
</p>
<p>
   Maybe you now think, that an API change means, that the API was not designed well. In many cases you
   are right, but there are many APIs, that are not designed to meet every special case of your
   application.

<p>
   The following example shows you how to enhance the <em>socialbookmark</em> library delivered
   with each release to meet your demands.
</p>

<h4 id="Chapter-2-1-Problem-description"><a href="#Chapter-2-1-Problem-description">2.1. Problem description</a></h4>
<p>
   The socialbookmark library contained in each <em>apf-codepack-*</em> release are
   intended to be included in the content area of your application via XML tag. For this reason, the
   module includes a taglib, whose characteristics are described on the <int:link pageid="093" /> page. The tag
   definition allows you to specify a page title within the tag definition, that is used as a title
   when bookmarking the current page. This definition is statically, because it is specified on tag
   definition time and not on execution time. This is problematically with CMS webpages, because there,
   titles must be dynamic!
</p>

<h4 id="Chapter-2-2-Analysis-of-the-existing-API"><a href="#Chapter-2-2-Analysis-of-the-existing-API">2.2. Analysis of the existing API</a></h4>
<p>
   To analyze the existing API you must ask yourself the question: <em>What is already possible and
   what is really missing?</em>. In case of the socialbookmark module, the answer is quite obvious:
   <em>static titles</em> are possible, <em>dynamic titles</em> not!
</p>

<h4 id="Chapter-2-3-API-extension-by-wrapping"><a href="#Chapter-2-3-API-extension-by-wrapping">2.3. API extension by wrapping</a></h4>
<p>
   A very common way of extending a API is to wrap it. <em>Wrapping</em> means, that you build
   a layer around the existing library - in this case a taglib - to enhance the functionality without
   changing the library itself.
</p>
<p>
   Let's at first have a look at the existing library. The taglib implements the APFObject's
   <em>transform()</em> method. Within this function the class passes the necessary attributes
   to the <em>SocialBookmarkBarManager</em> and asks him to give back the bookmark elements. The
   source code of the taglib (please refer to the <em>/APF/modules/socialbookmark/pres/taglib</em>
   folder in the <em>apf-codepack-*</em> release) is displayed in the following code box (comments
   were dropped):
</p>
<gen:highlight type="php">
namespace APF\modules\socialbookmark\pres\taglib;

use APF\core\pagecontroller\Document;
use APF\modules\socialbookmark\biz\SocialBookmarkBarManager;

class SocialBookmarkBarTag extends Document {

   public function __construct() {
      $this->setAttribute('width', '20');
      $this->setAttribute('height', '20');
      $this->setAttribute('title', null);
      $this->setAttribute('url', null);
   }

   public function transform() {

      $bm = & $this->getServiceObject('APF\modules\socialbookmark\biz\SocialBookmarkBarManager');
      /* @var $bm SocialBookmarkBarManager */

      $bm->setImageWidth($this->getAttributes('width'));
      $bm->setImageHeight($this->getAttributes('height'));
      $bm->setUrl($this->getAttribute('url'));
      $bm->setTitle($this->getAttribute('title'));

      return $bm->getBookmarkCode();
   }

}
</gen:highlight>
<p>
   In order to make the title passed to the bookmark service dynamic, ist is well to define another
   tag library, that only contains the difference of functionality, but uses the existing library. To
   make it easier to show the proceeding to you, I define, that the tag should be named
   <em>my:bookmark</em>. The taglib then contains the following source code:
</p>
<gen:highlight type="php">
namespace VENDOR\socialbookmark\pres\tags;

use APF\modules\socialbookmark\pres\taglib\SocialBookmarkBarTag;

class MyBookmarkTag extends SocialBookmarkBarTag {

   public function transform() {

      // gather title of current page
      $title = ...;

      // fill the title attribute, that is used by the parent class
      $this->setAttributes('title', $title);

      // generate output with aid of the parent class
      return parent::transform();

   }

}
</gen:highlight>
<p>
   As you can see in the code box above, the <em>transform()</em> only contains the gathering
   of the page's title. There, the title is assigned to the attributes offset used by the parent class.
   The core function is still done by the <em>SocialBookmarkBarTag</em> class. Because of the
   fact, that our wrapper class inherits from <em>SocialBookmarkBarTag</em>, it is still
   possible to use the
</p>
<ul>
  <li>width</li>
  <li>height</li>
  <li>target</li>
</ul>
<p>
   attributes within the tag definition. The following code shows you how to include the new taglib into
   your templates:
</p>
<gen:highlight type="apf-xml">
&lt;core:addtaglib
   class="VENDOR\socialbookmark\pres\tags\MyBookmarkTag"
   prefix="my"
   name="bookmark"
/&gt;
&lt;my:bookmark width="16" height="16" /&gt;
</gen:highlight>
<p>
   Details on tag implementation can be found under <int:link pageid="147" />.
</p>

<h4 id="Chapter-2-4-Update-handling"><a href="#Chapter-2-4-Update-handling">2.4. Update handling</a></h4>
<p>
   In case of API changes to the third-party library, adaptation to the new API is limited to filling
   the attribute <em>title</em>, because the call of the parent <em>transform()</em> is still
   the same. A second advantage is, that the API of the wrapper class <em>MyBookmarkTag</em>
   remains the same and the components using the API of the wrapper class must not be changed. The
   example described in the present tutorial only contained the enhancement of taglibs, but this principle
   can be adopted to any other domain.
